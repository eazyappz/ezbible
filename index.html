<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Genesis/">Genesis</a></td>
<td><em>Genesis speaks of beginnings and is foundational to the understanding of the rest of the Bible. It is supremely a book that speaks about relationships, highlighting those between God and his creation, between God and humankind, and between human beings.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Exodus/">Exodus</a></td>
<td><em>Exodus describes the history of the Israelites leaving Egypt after slavery. The book lays a foundational theology in which God reveals his name, his attributes, his redemption, his law and how he is to be worshiped.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Leviticus/">Leviticus</a></td>
<td><em>Leviticus receives its name from the Septuagint (the pre-Christian Greek translation of the Old Testament) and means "concerning the Levites" (the priests of Israel). It serves as a manual of regulations enabling the holy King to set up his earthly throne among the people of his kingdom. It explains how they are to be his holy people and to worship him in a holy manner.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Numbers/">Numbers</a></td>
<td><em>Numbers relates the story of Israel's journey from Mount Sinai to the plains of Moab on the border of Canaan. The book tells of the murmuring and rebellion of God's people and of their subsequent judgment.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Deuteronomy/">Deuteronomy</a></td>
<td><em>Deuteronomy ("repetition of the Law") serves as a reminder to God's people about His covenant. The book is a "pause" before Joshua's conquest begins and a reminder of what God required.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Joshua/">Joshua</a></td>
<td><em>Joshua is a story of conquest and fulfillment for the people of God. After many years of slavery in Egypt and 40 years in the desert, the Israelites were finally allowed to enter the land promised to their fathers.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Judges/">Judges</a></td>
<td><em>The book of Judges depicts the life of Israel in the Promised Land—from the death of Joshua to the rise of the monarchy. It tells of urgent appeals to God in times of crisis and apostasy, moving the Lord to raise up leaders (judges) through whom He throws off foreign oppressors and restores the land to peace.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/Ruth/">Ruth</a></td>
<td><em>The book of Ruth has been called one of the best examples of short narrative ever written. It presents an account of the remnant of true faith and piety in the period of the judges through the fall and restoration of Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth (an ancestor of King David and Jesus).</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="Old%20Testament/1Samuel/">1 Samuel</a></td>
<td><em>Samuel relates God's establishment of a political system in Israel headed by a human king. Through Samuel's life, we see the rise of the monarchy and the tragedy of its first king, Saul.</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Mark/">Mark</a></td>
<td><em>Since Mark's Gospel (the "good news") is traditionally associated with Rome, it may have been occasioned by the persecutions of the Roman church in the period c. A.D. 64-67. Mark may be writing to prepare his readers for such suffering by placing before them the life of our Lord.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Luke/">Luke</a></td>
<td><em>Luke's Gospel (the "good news") was written to strengthen the faith of all believers and to answer the attacks of unbelievers. It was presented to debunk some disconnected and ill-founded reports about Jesus. Luke wanted to show that the place of the Gentile (non-Jewish) Christian in God's kingdom is based on the teaching of Jesus.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/John/">John</a></td>
<td><em>John's Gospel (the "good news") is rather different from the other three, highlighting events not detailed in the others. The author himself states his main purpose clearly in 20:31: "that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Acts/">Acts</a></td>
<td><em>The book of Acts provides a bridge for the writings of the New Testament. As a second volume to Luke's Gospel, it joins what Jesus "began to do and to teach" as told in the Gospels with what he continued to do and teach through the apostles' preaching and the establishment of the church.</em></td>

<td><a href="New%20Testament/Romans/">Romans</a></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/1Corinthians/">1 Corinthians</a></td>
<td><em>The first letter to the Corinthians revolves around the theme of problems in Christian conduct in the church. It thus has to do with progressive sanctification, the continuing development of a holy character. Obviously Paul was personally concerned with the Corinthians' problems, revealing a true pastor's (shepherd's) heart.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/2Corinthians/">2 Corinthians</a></td>
<td><em>Because of the occasion that prompted this letter, Paul had a number of purposes in mind: to express the comfort and joy Paul felt because the Corinthians had responded favorably to his painful letter; to let them know about the trouble he went through in the province of Asia; and to explain to them the true nature (its joys, sufferings and rewards) and high calling of Christian ministry.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Galatians/">Galatians</a></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Ephesians/">Ephesians</a></td>
<td><em>Unlike several of the other letters Paul wrote, Ephesians does not address any particular error or heresy.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Philippians/">Philippians</a></td>
<td><em>Paul's primary purpose in writing this letter was to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him upon learning of his detention at Rome. However, he makes use of this occasion to fulfill several other desires: (1) to report on his own circumstances; (2) to encourage the Philippians to stand firm in the face of persecution and rejoice regardless of circumstances; and (3) to exhort them to humility and unity.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Colossians/">Colossians</a></td>
<td><em>Paul's purpose is to refute the Colossian heresy. To accomplish this goal, he exalts Christ as the very image of God, the Creator, the preexistent sustainer of all things, the head of the church, the first to be resurrected, the fullness of deity (God) in bodily form, and the reconciler.</em></td>

<td><a href="New%20Testament/1Thessalonians/">1 Thessalonians</a></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/2Thessalonians/">2 Thessalonians</a></td>

This is the first of the "Pastoral Epistles."</em></td>
</tr>

<td><a href="New%20Testament/2Timothy/">2 Timothy</a></td>
<td><em>Paul was concerned about the welfare of the churches during this time of persecution under Nero, and he admonishes Timothy to guard the gospel, to persevere in it, to keep on preaching it, and, if necessary, to suffer for it. This is the second "Pastoral Epistle."</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Titus/">Titus</a></td>
<td><em>Apparently Paul introduced Christianity in Crete when he and Titus visited the island, after which he left Titus there to organize the converts. Paul sent the letter with Zenas and Apollos, who were on a journey that took them through Crete, to give Titus personal authorization and guidance in meeting opposition, instructions about faith and conduct, and warnings about false teachers. This is the last of the "Pastoral Epistles."</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Philemon/">Philemon</a></td>
<td><em>To win Philemon's willing acceptance of the runaway slave Onesimus, Paul writes very tactfully and in a lighthearted tone, which he creates with wordplay. The appeal is organized in a way prescribed by ancient Greek and Roman teachers: to build rapport, to persuade the mind, and to move the emotions.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Hebrews/">Hebrews</a></td>
<td><em>The theme of Hebrews is the absolute supremacy and sufficiency of Jesus Christ as revealer and as mediator of God's grace. A striking feature of this presentation of the gospel is the unique manner in which the author employs expositions of eight specific passages of the Old Testament Scriptures.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/James/">James</a></td>
<td><em>Characteristics that make the letter distinctive are: (1) its unmistakably Jewish nature; (2) its emphasis on vital Christianity, characterized by good deeds and a faith that works (genuine faith must and will be accompanied by a consistent lifestyle); (3) its simple organization; (4) and its familiarity with Jesus' teachings preserved in the Sermon on the Mount.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/1Peter/">1 Peter</a></td>
<td><em>Although 1 Peter is a short letter, it touches on various doctrines and has much to say about Christian life and duties. It is not surprising that different readers have found it to have different principal themes. For example, it has been characterized as a letter of separation, of suffering and persecution, of suffering and glory, of hope, of pilgrimage, of courage, and as a letter dealing with the true grace of God.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/2Peter/">2 Peter</a></td>
<td><em>In his first letter Peter feeds Christ's sheep by instructing them how to deal with persecution from outside the church; in this second letter he teaches them how to deal with false teachers and evildoers who have come into the church.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/1John/">1 John</a></td>
<td><em>John's readers were confronted with an early form of Gnostic teaching of the Cerinthian variety. This heresy was also libertine, throwing off all moral restraints. Consequently, John wrote this letter with two basic purposes in mind: (1) to expose false teachers and (2) to give believers assurance of salvation.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/2John/">2 John</a></td>
<td><em>During the first two centuries the gospel was taken from place to place by traveling evangelists and teachers. Believers customarily took these missionaries into their homes and gave them provisions for their journey when they left. Since Gnostic teachers also relied on this practice, 2 John was written to urge discernment in supporting traveling teachers</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/3John/">3 John</a></td>
<td><em>Itinerant teachers sent out by John were rejected in one of the churches in the province of Asia by a dictatorial leader, Diotrephes, who even excommunicated members who showed hospitality to John's messengers. John wrote this letter to commend Gaius for supporting the teachers and, indirectly, to warn Diotrephes.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Jude/">Jude</a></td>
<td><em>Although Jude was very eager to write to his readers about salvation, he felt that he must instead warn them about certain immoral men circulating among them who were perverting the grace of God. Apparently these false teachers were trying to convince believers that being saved by grace gave them license to sin since their sins would no longer be held against them.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><a href="New%20Testament/Revelation/">Revelation</a></td>
<td><em>John writes to encourage the faithful to resist staunchly the demands of emperor worship. He informs his readers that the final showdown between God and Satan is imminent. Satan will increase his persecution of believers, but they must stand fast, even to death. They are sealed against any spiritual harm and will soon be vindicated when Christ returns, when the wicked are forever destroyed, and when God's people enter an eternity of glory and blessedness.</em></td>
