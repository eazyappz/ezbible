<h1 id="jeremiah">Jeremiah</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1"><a id="C1">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>To whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>Then the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.<br />
    <a id="C1V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then said I, Ah, Lord God ! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.<br />
    <a id="C1V7"><em>7</em> </a>But the Lord said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.<br />
    <a id="C1V8"><em>8</em> </a>Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C1V9"><em>9</em> </a>Then the Lord put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.<br />
    <a id="C1V10"><em>10</em> </a>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.<br />
    <a id="C1V11"><em>11</em> </a>Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.<br />
    <a id="C1V12"><em>12</em> </a>Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.<br />
    <a id="C1V13"><em>13</em> </a>And the word of the Lord came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is toward the north.<br />
    <a id="C1V14"><em>14</em> </a>Then the Lord said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.<br />
    <a id="C1V15"><em>15</em> </a>For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the Lord ; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.<br />
    <a id="C1V16"><em>16</em> </a>And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.<br />
    <a id="C1V17"><em>17</em> </a>Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.<br />
    <a id="C1V18"><em>18</em> </a>For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.<br />
    <a id="C1V19"><em>19</em> </a>And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord , to deliver thee.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-2"><a id="C2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the Lord ; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>Israel was holiness unto the Lord , and the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>Hear ye the word of the Lord , O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:<br />
    <a id="C2V5"><em>5</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord , What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?<br />
    <a id="C2V6"><em>6</em> </a>Neither said they, Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?<br />
    <a id="C2V7"><em>7</em> </a>And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.<br />
    <a id="C2V8"><em>8</em> </a>The priests said not, Where is the Lord ? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.<br />
    <a id="C2V9"><em>9</em> </a>Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the Lord , and with your children's children will I plead.<br />
    <a id="C2V10"><em>10</em> </a>For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.<br />
    <a id="C2V11"><em>11</em> </a>Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.<br />
    <a id="C2V12"><em>12</em> </a>Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C2V13"><em>13</em> </a>For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<br />
    <a id="C2V14"><em>14</em> </a>Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?<br />
    <a id="C2V15"><em>15</em> </a>The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.<br />
    <a id="C2V16"><em>16</em> </a>Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.<br />
    <a id="C2V17"><em>17</em> </a>Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, when he led thee by the way?<br />
    <a id="C2V18"><em>18</em> </a>And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?<br />
    <a id="C2V19"><em>19</em> </a>Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.<br />
    <a id="C2V20"><em>20</em> </a>For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.<br />
    <a id="C2V21"><em>21</em> </a>Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?<br />
    <a id="C2V22"><em>22</em> </a>For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord God .<br />
    <a id="C2V23"><em>23</em> </a>How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;<br />
    <a id="C2V24"><em>24</em> </a>A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.<br />
    <a id="C2V25"><em>25</em> </a>Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.<br />
    <a id="C2V26"><em>26</em> </a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets.<br />
    <a id="C2V27"><em>27</em> </a>Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.<br />
    <a id="C2V28"><em>28</em> </a>But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.<br />
    <a id="C2V29"><em>29</em> </a>Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C2V30"><em>30</em> </a>In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.<br />
    <a id="C2V31"><em>31</em> </a>O generation, see ye the word of the Lord . Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?<br />
    <a id="C2V32"><em>32</em> </a>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.<br />
    <a id="C2V33"><em>33</em> </a>Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.<br />
    <a id="C2V34"><em>34</em> </a>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.<br />
    <a id="C2V35"><em>35</em> </a>Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.<br />
    <a id="C2V36"><em>36</em> </a>Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.<br />
    <a id="C2V37"><em>37</em> </a>Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the Lord hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-3"><a id="C3">Chapter 3</a></h2>
<p><a id="C3V1"><em>1</em> </a>They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C3V2"><em>2</em> </a>Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.<br />
    <a id="C3V3"><em>3</em> </a>Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.<br />

    <a id="C3V8"><em>8</em> </a>And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.<br />
    <a id="C3V9"><em>9</em> </a>And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.<br />

    <a id="C3V21"><em>21</em> </a>A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the Lord their God.<br />

    <a id="C7V24"><em>24</em> </a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.<br />

    <a id="C7V29"><em>29</em> </a>Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the Lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.<br />
    <a id="C7V30"><em>30</em> </a>For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the Lord : they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.<br />
    <a id="C7V31"><em>31</em> </a>And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.<br />
    <a id="C7V32"><em>32</em> </a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.<br />
    <a id="C7V33"><em>33</em> </a>And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.<br />

    <a id="C26V7"><em>7</em> </a>So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C26V8"><em>8</em> </a>Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the Lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.<br />

    <a id="C28V12"><em>12</em> </a>Then the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah the prophet, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying,<br />

    <a id="C29V19"><em>19</em> </a>Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the Lord , which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the Lord .<br />

    <a id="C29V22"><em>22</em> </a>And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;<br />
    <a id="C29V23"><em>23</em> </a>Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C29V24"><em>24</em> </a>Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,<br />

    <a id="C29V26"><em>26</em> </a>The Lord hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the Lord , for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.<br />
    <a id="C29V27"><em>27</em> </a>Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?<br />
    <a id="C29V28"><em>28</em> </a>For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.<br />
    <a id="C29V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.<br />
    <a id="C29V30"><em>30</em> </a>Then came the word of the Lord unto Jeremiah, saying,<br />
    <a id="C29V31"><em>31</em> </a>Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:<br />

    <a id="C32V3"><em>3</em> </a>For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;<br />
    <a id="C32V4"><em>4</em> </a>And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;<br />
    <a id="C32V5"><em>5</em> </a>And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the Lord : though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper.<br />
    <a id="C32V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C32V7"><em>7</em> </a>Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.<br />

Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C32V9"><em>9</em> </a>And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.<br />
    <a id="C32V10"><em>10</em> </a>And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.<br />
    <a id="C32V11"><em>11</em> </a>So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open:<br />
    <a id="C32V12"><em>12</em> </a>And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.<br />
    <a id="C32V13"><em>13</em> </a>And I charged Baruch before them, saying,<br />

    <a id="C32V25"><em>25</em> </a>And thou hast said unto me, O Lord God , Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.<br />

    <a id="C32V30"><em>30</em> </a>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C32V31"><em>31</em> </a>For this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,<br />

    <a id="C32V33"><em>33</em> </a>And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.<br />
    <a id="C32V34"><em>34</em> </a>But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.<br />
    <a id="C32V35"><em>35</em> </a>And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.<br />
    <a id="C32V36"><em>36</em> </a>And now therefore thus saith the Lord , the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;<br />

    <a id="C32V38"><em>38</em> </a>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:<br />
    <a id="C32V39"><em>39</em> </a>And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:<br />

    <a id="C34V11"><em>11</em> </a>But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.<br />

    <a id="C37V19"><em>19</em> </a>Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?<br />
    <a id="C37V20"><em>20</em> </a>Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.<br />
    <a id="C37V21"><em>21</em> </a>Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-38"><a id="C38">Chapter 38</a></h2>
<p><a id="C38V1"><em>1</em> </a>Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,<br />
    <a id="C38V2"><em>2</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord , He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.<br />
    <a id="C38V3"><em>3</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it.<br />
    <a id="C38V4"><em>4</em> </a>Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.<br />
    <a id="C38V5"><em>5</em> </a>Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.<br />
    <a id="C38V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.<br />
    <a id="C38V7"><em>7</em> </a>Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;<br />
    <a id="C38V8"><em>8</em> </a>Ebedmelech went forth out of the king's house, and spake to the king saying,<br />
    <a id="C38V9"><em>9</em> </a>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.<br />
    <a id="C38V10"><em>10</em> </a>Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.<br />
    <a id="C38V11"><em>11</em> </a>So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.<br />
    <a id="C38V12"><em>12</em> </a>And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.<br />
    <a id="C38V13"><em>13</em> </a>So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.<br />
    <a id="C38V14"><em>14</em> </a>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the Lord : and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.<br />
    <a id="C38V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?<br />
    <a id="C38V16"><em>16</em> </a>So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the Lord liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.<br />
    <a id="C38V17"><em>17</em> </a>Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the Lord , the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:<br />
    <a id="C38V18"><em>18</em> </a>But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.<br />
    <a id="C38V19"><em>19</em> </a>And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.<br />
    <a id="C38V20"><em>20</em> </a>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the Lord , which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.<br />
    <a id="C38V21"><em>21</em> </a>But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me:<br />
    <a id="C38V22"><em>22</em> </a>And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.<br />
    <a id="C38V23"><em>23</em> </a>So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.<br />
    <a id="C38V24"><em>24</em> </a>Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.<br />
    <a id="C38V25"><em>25</em> </a>But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:<br />
    <a id="C38V26"><em>26</em> </a>Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there.<br />
    <a id="C38V27"><em>27</em> </a>Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.<br />
    <a id="C38V28"><em>28</em> </a>So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-39"><a id="C39">Chapter 39</a></h2>
<p><a id="C39V1"><em>1</em> </a>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.<br />
    <a id="C39V2"><em>2</em> </a>And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.<br />
    <a id="C39V3"><em>3</em> </a>And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C39V4"><em>4</em> </a>And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.<br />
    <a id="C39V5"><em>5</em> </a>But the Chaldeans' army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.<br />
    <a id="C39V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.<br />
    <a id="C39V7"><em>7</em> </a>Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C39V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.<br />
    <a id="C39V9"><em>9</em> </a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.<br />
    <a id="C39V10"><em>10</em> </a>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.<br />
    <a id="C39V11"><em>11</em> </a>Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,<br />
    <a id="C39V12"><em>12</em> </a>Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.<br />
    <a id="C39V13"><em>13</em> </a>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;<br />
    <a id="C39V14"><em>14</em> </a>Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.<br />
    <a id="C39V15"><em>15</em> </a>Now the word of the Lord came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,<br />
    <a id="C39V16"><em>16</em> </a>Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee.<br />
    <a id="C39V17"><em>17</em> </a>But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the Lord : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid.<br />
    <a id="C39V18"><em>18</em> </a>For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord .  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-40"><a id="C40">Chapter 40</a></h2>
<p><a id="C40V1"><em>1</em> </a>The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord , after that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C40V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The Lord thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.<br />
    <a id="C40V3"><em>3</em> </a>Now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the Lord , and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.<br />
    <a id="C40V4"><em>4</em> </a>And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.<br />
    <a id="C40V5"><em>5</em> </a>Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.<br />
    <a id="C40V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.<br />
    <a id="C40V7"><em>7</em> </a>Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;<br />
    <a id="C40V8"><em>8</em> </a>Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.<br />
    <a id="C40V9"><em>9</em> </a>And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.<br />
    <a id="C40V10"><em>10</em> </a>As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.<br />
    <a id="C40V11"><em>11</em> </a>Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;<br />
    <a id="C40V12"><em>12</em> </a>Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits very much.<br />
    <a id="C40V13"><em>13</em> </a>Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,<br />
    <a id="C40V14"><em>14</em> </a>And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.<br />
    <a id="C40V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?<br />
    <a id="C40V16"><em>16</em> </a>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-41"><a id="C41">Chapter 41</a></h2>
<p><a id="C41V1"><em>1</em> </a>Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.<br />
    <a id="C41V2"><em>2</em> </a>Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.<br />
    <a id="C41V3"><em>3</em> </a>Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war.<br />
    <a id="C41V4"><em>4</em> </a>And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it,<br />
    <a id="C41V5"><em>5</em> </a>That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C41V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.<br />
    <a id="C41V7"><em>7</em> </a>And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him.<br />
    <a id="C41V8"><em>8</em> </a>But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.<br />
    <a id="C41V9"><em>9</em> </a>Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.<br />
    <a id="C41V10"><em>10</em> </a>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.<br />
    <a id="C41V11"><em>11</em> </a>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,<br />
    <a id="C41V12"><em>12</em> </a>Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.<br />
    <a id="C41V13"><em>13</em> </a>Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad.<br />

    <a id="C41V15"><em>15</em> </a>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.<br />
    <a id="C41V16"><em>16</em> </a>Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon:<br />
    <a id="C41V17"><em>17</em> </a>And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,<br />

    <a id="C44V3"><em>3</em> </a>Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.<br />
    <a id="C44V4"><em>4</em> </a>Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.<br />
    <a id="C44V5"><em>5</em> </a>But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.<br />
    <a id="C44V6"><em>6</em> </a>Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.<br />

    <a id="C44V8"><em>8</em> </a>In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?<br />
    <a id="C44V9"><em>9</em> </a>Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?<br />
    <a id="C44V10"><em>10</em> </a>They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers.<br />
    <a id="C44V11"><em>11</em> </a>Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah.<br />
    <a id="C44V12"><em>12</em> </a>And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.<br />
    <a id="C44V13"><em>13</em> </a>For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence:<br />

    <a id="C44V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,<br />

    <a id="C44V17"><em>17</em> </a>But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.<br />
    <a id="C44V18"><em>18</em> </a>But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.<br />

    <a id="C44V24"><em>24</em> </a>Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the Lord , all Judah that are in the land of Egypt:<br />
    <a id="C44V25"><em>25</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.<br />
    <a id="C44V26"><em>26</em> </a>Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord , all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord , that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord God liveth.<br />
    <a id="C44V27"><em>27</em> </a>Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them.<br />
    <a id="C44V28"><em>28</em> </a>Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or their's.<br />
    <a id="C44V29"><em>29</em> </a>And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the Lord , that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil:<br />

    <a id="C51V46"><em>46</em> </a>And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.<br />
    <a id="C51V47"><em>47</em> </a>Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.<br />
    <a id="C51V48"><em>48</em> </a>Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C51V49"><em>49</em> </a>As Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth.<br />
    <a id="C51V50"><em>50</em> </a>Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the Lord afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.<br />
    <a id="C51V51"><em>51</em> </a>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the Lord 's house.<br />
    <a id="C51V52"><em>52</em> </a>Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord , that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan.<br />
    <a id="C51V53"><em>53</em> </a>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C51V54"><em>54</em> </a>A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans:<br />
    <a id="C51V55"><em>55</em> </a>Because the Lord hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered:<br />
    <a id="C51V56"><em>56</em> </a>Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the Lord God of recompences shall surely requite.<br />
    <a id="C51V57"><em>57</em> </a>And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.<br />
    <a id="C51V58"><em>58</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.<br />
    <a id="C51V59"><em>59</em> </a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince.<br />
    <a id="C51V60"><em>60</em> </a>So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C51V61"><em>61</em> </a>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;<br />
    <a id="C51V62"><em>62</em> </a>Then shalt thou say, O Lord , thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.<br />
    <a id="C51V63"><em>63</em> </a>And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:<br />
    <a id="C51V64"><em>64</em> </a>And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-52"><a id="C52">Chapter 52</a></h2>
<p><a id="C52V1"><em>1</em> </a>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.<br />
    <a id="C52V2"><em>2</em> </a>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the Lord , according to all that Jehoiakim had done.<br />
    <a id="C52V3"><em>3</em> </a>For through the anger of the Lord it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C52V4"><em>4</em> </a>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.<br />
    <a id="C52V5"><em>5</em> </a>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.<br />
    <a id="C52V6"><em>6</em> </a>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.<br />
    <a id="C52V7"><em>7</em> </a>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.<br />
    <a id="C52V8"><em>8</em> </a>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.<br />
    <a id="C52V9"><em>9</em> </a>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.<br />
    <a id="C52V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.<br />
    <a id="C52V11"><em>11</em> </a>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.<br />
    <a id="C52V12"><em>12</em> </a>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,<br />
    <a id="C52V13"><em>13</em> </a>And burned the house of the Lord , and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire:<br />
    <a id="C52V14"><em>14</em> </a>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.<br />
    <a id="C52V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.<br />
    <a id="C52V16"><em>16</em> </a>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.<br />
    <a id="C52V17"><em>17</em> </a>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord , and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the Lord , the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C52V18"><em>18</em> </a>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.<br />
    <a id="C52V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.<br />
    <a id="C52V20"><em>20</em> </a>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the Lord : the brass of all these vessels was without weight.<br />
    <a id="C52V21"><em>21</em> </a>And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.<br />
    <a id="C52V22"><em>22</em> </a>And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.<br />
    <a id="C52V23"><em>23</em> </a>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.<br />
    <a id="C52V24"><em>24</em> </a>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:<br />
    <a id="C52V25"><em>25</em> </a>He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.<br />
    <a id="C52V26"><em>26</em> </a>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.<br />
    <a id="C52V27"><em>27</em> </a>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.<br />
    <a id="C52V28"><em>28</em> </a>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:<br />
    <a id="C52V29"><em>29</em> </a>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:<br />
    <a id="C52V30"><em>30</em> </a>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.<br />
    <a id="C52V31"><em>31</em> </a>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison.<br />
    <a id="C52V32"><em>32</em> </a>And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,<br />
    <a id="C52V33"><em>33</em> </a>And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.<br />
    <a id="C52V34"><em>34</em> </a>And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.  </p></div>
