<h1 id="job">Job</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1"><a id="C1">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.<br />
    <a id="C1V6"><em>6</em> </a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them.<br />
    <a id="C1V7"><em>7</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord , and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br />
    <a id="C1V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?<br />
    <a id="C1V9"><em>9</em> </a>Then Satan answered the Lord , and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?<br />
    <a id="C1V10"><em>10</em> </a>Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.<br />
    <a id="C1V11"><em>11</em> </a>But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.<br />
    <a id="C1V12"><em>12</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C1V13"><em>13</em> </a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:<br />
    <a id="C1V14"><em>14</em> </a>And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:<br />
    <a id="C1V15"><em>15</em> </a>And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br />
    <a id="C1V16"><em>16</em> </a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br />
    <a id="C1V17"><em>17</em> </a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br />
    <a id="C1V18"><em>18</em> </a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:<br />
    <a id="C1V19"><em>19</em> </a>And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.<br />
    <a id="C1V20"><em>20</em> </a>Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,<br />
    <a id="C1V21"><em>21</em> </a>And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C1V22"><em>22</em> </a>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-2"><a id="C2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord , and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>And Satan answered the Lord , and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.<br />
    <a id="C2V5"><em>5</em> </a>But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.<br />
    <a id="C2V6"><em>6</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.<br />
    <a id="C2V7"><em>7</em> </a>So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.<br />
    <a id="C2V8"><em>8</em> </a>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.<br />
    <a id="C2V9"><em>9</em> </a>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die.<br />
    <a id="C2V10"><em>10</em> </a>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.<br />
    <a id="C2V11"><em>11</em> </a>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.<br />
    <a id="C2V12"><em>12</em> </a>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.<br />
    <a id="C2V13"><em>13</em> </a>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-3"><a id="C3">Chapter 3</a></h2>
<p><a id="C3V1"><em>1</em> </a>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.<br />
    <a id="C3V2"><em>2</em> </a>And Job spake, and said,<br />
    <a id="C3V3"><em>3</em> </a>Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.<br />
    <a id="C3V4"><em>4</em> </a>Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.<br />
    <a id="C3V5"><em>5</em> </a>Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.<br />
    <a id="C3V6"><em>6</em> </a>As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.<br />
    <a id="C3V7"><em>7</em> </a>Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.<br />
    <a id="C3V8"><em>8</em> </a>Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.<br />
    <a id="C3V9"><em>9</em> </a>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:<br />
    <a id="C3V10"><em>10</em> </a>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.<br />
    <a id="C3V11"><em>11</em> </a>Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?<br />
    <a id="C3V12"><em>12</em> </a>Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?<br />
    <a id="C3V13"><em>13</em> </a>For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,<br />
    <a id="C3V14"><em>14</em> </a>With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;<br />
    <a id="C3V15"><em>15</em> </a>Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:<br />
    <a id="C3V16"><em>16</em> </a>Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.<br />
    <a id="C3V17"><em>17</em> </a>There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.<br />
    <a id="C3V18"><em>18</em> </a>There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.<br />
    <a id="C3V19"><em>19</em> </a>The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.<br />
    <a id="C3V20"><em>20</em> </a>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;<br />
    <a id="C3V21"><em>21</em> </a>Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;<br />
    <a id="C3V22"><em>22</em> </a>Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?<br />
    <a id="C3V23"><em>23</em> </a>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?<br />
    <a id="C3V24"><em>24</em> </a>For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.<br />
    <a id="C3V25"><em>25</em> </a>For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.<br />
    <a id="C3V26"><em>26</em> </a>I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-4"><a id="C4">Chapter 4</a></h2>
<p><a id="C4V1"><em>1</em> </a>Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,<br />
    <a id="C4V2"><em>2</em> </a>If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?<br />
    <a id="C4V3"><em>3</em> </a>Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.<br />
    <a id="C4V4"><em>4</em> </a>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.<br />
    <a id="C4V5"><em>5</em> </a>But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.<br />
    <a id="C4V6"><em>6</em> </a>Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?<br />
    <a id="C4V7"><em>7</em> </a>Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?<br />
    <a id="C4V8"><em>8</em> </a>Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.<br />
    <a id="C4V9"><em>9</em> </a>By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.<br />
    <a id="C4V10"><em>10</em> </a>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.<br />
    <a id="C4V11"><em>11</em> </a>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.<br />
    <a id="C4V12"><em>12</em> </a>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.<br />
    <a id="C4V13"><em>13</em> </a>In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,<br />
    <a id="C4V14"><em>14</em> </a>Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.<br />
    <a id="C4V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:<br />
    <a id="C4V16"><em>16</em> </a>It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,<br />
    <a id="C4V17"><em>17</em> </a>Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?<br />
    <a id="C4V18"><em>18</em> </a>Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:<br />
    <a id="C4V19"><em>19</em> </a>How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?<br />
    <a id="C4V20"><em>20</em> </a>They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.<br />
    <a id="C4V21"><em>21</em> </a>Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-5"><a id="C5">Chapter 5</a></h2>
<p><a id="C5V1"><em>1</em> </a>Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?<br />
    <a id="C5V2"><em>2</em> </a>For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.<br />
    <a id="C5V3"><em>3</em> </a>I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.<br />
    <a id="C5V4"><em>4</em> </a>His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.<br />
    <a id="C5V5"><em>5</em> </a>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.<br />
    <a id="C5V6"><em>6</em> </a>Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;<br />
    <a id="C5V7"><em>7</em> </a>Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.<br />

    <a id="C39V2"><em>2</em> </a>Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?<br />
    <a id="C39V3"><em>3</em> </a>They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.<br />
    <a id="C39V4"><em>4</em> </a>Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.<br />
    <a id="C39V5"><em>5</em> </a>Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?<br />
    <a id="C39V6"><em>6</em> </a>Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.<br />
    <a id="C39V7"><em>7</em> </a>He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.<br />
    <a id="C39V8"><em>8</em> </a>The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.<br />
    <a id="C39V9"><em>9</em> </a>Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?<br />
    <a id="C39V10"><em>10</em> </a>Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?<br />
    <a id="C39V11"><em>11</em> </a>Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?<br />
    <a id="C39V12"><em>12</em> </a>Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?<br />
    <a id="C39V13"><em>13</em> </a>Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?<br />
    <a id="C39V14"><em>14</em> </a>Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,<br />
    <a id="C39V15"><em>15</em> </a>And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.<br />
    <a id="C39V16"><em>16</em> </a>She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;<br />
    <a id="C39V17"><em>17</em> </a>Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.<br />
    <a id="C39V18"><em>18</em> </a>What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.<br />
    <a id="C39V19"><em>19</em> </a>Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?<br />
    <a id="C39V20"><em>20</em> </a>Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.<br />
    <a id="C39V21"><em>21</em> </a>He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.<br />
    <a id="C39V22"><em>22</em> </a>He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.<br />
    <a id="C39V23"><em>23</em> </a>The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.<br />
    <a id="C39V24"><em>24</em> </a>He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.<br />
    <a id="C39V25"><em>25</em> </a>He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.<br />
    <a id="C39V26"><em>26</em> </a>Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?<br />
    <a id="C39V27"><em>27</em> </a>Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?<br />
    <a id="C39V28"><em>28</em> </a>She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.<br />
    <a id="C39V29"><em>29</em> </a>From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.<br />
    <a id="C39V30"><em>30</em> </a>Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-40"><a id="C40">Chapter 40</a></h2>
<p><a id="C40V1"><em>1</em> </a>Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said,<br />
    <a id="C40V2"><em>2</em> </a>Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.<br />
    <a id="C40V3"><em>3</em> </a>Then Job answered the Lord , and said,<br />
    <a id="C40V4"><em>4</em> </a>Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.<br />
    <a id="C40V5"><em>5</em> </a>Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.<br />
    <a id="C40V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,<br />
    <a id="C40V7"><em>7</em> </a>Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br />
    <a id="C40V8"><em>8</em> </a>Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?<br />
    <a id="C40V9"><em>9</em> </a>Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?<br />
    <a id="C40V10"><em>10</em> </a>Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.<br />
    <a id="C40V11"><em>11</em> </a>Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.<br />
    <a id="C40V12"><em>12</em> </a>Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.<br />
    <a id="C40V13"><em>13</em> </a>Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.<br />
    <a id="C40V14"><em>14</em> </a>Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.<br />
    <a id="C40V15"><em>15</em> </a>Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.<br />
    <a id="C40V16"><em>16</em> </a>Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.<br />
    <a id="C40V17"><em>17</em> </a>He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.<br />
    <a id="C40V18"><em>18</em> </a>His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.<br />
    <a id="C40V19"><em>19</em> </a>He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.<br />
    <a id="C40V20"><em>20</em> </a>Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.<br />
    <a id="C40V21"><em>21</em> </a>He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.<br />
    <a id="C40V22"><em>22</em> </a>The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.<br />
    <a id="C40V23"><em>23</em> </a>Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.<br />
    <a id="C40V24"><em>24</em> </a>He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-41"><a id="C41">Chapter 41</a></h2>
<p><a id="C41V1"><em>1</em> </a>Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?<br />
    <a id="C41V2"><em>2</em> </a>Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?<br />
    <a id="C41V3"><em>3</em> </a>Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?<br />
    <a id="C41V4"><em>4</em> </a>Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?<br />
    <a id="C41V5"><em>5</em> </a>Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?<br />
    <a id="C41V6"><em>6</em> </a>Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?<br />
    <a id="C41V7"><em>7</em> </a>Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?<br />
    <a id="C41V8"><em>8</em> </a>Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.<br />
    <a id="C41V9"><em>9</em> </a>Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?<br />
    <a id="C41V10"><em>10</em> </a>None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?<br />
    <a id="C41V11"><em>11</em> </a>Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.<br />
    <a id="C41V12"><em>12</em> </a>I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.<br />
    <a id="C41V13"><em>13</em> </a>Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?<br />
    <a id="C41V14"><em>14</em> </a>Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.<br />
    <a id="C41V15"><em>15</em> </a>His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.<br />
    <a id="C41V16"><em>16</em> </a>One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.<br />
    <a id="C41V17"><em>17</em> </a>They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.<br />
    <a id="C41V18"><em>18</em> </a>By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.<br />
    <a id="C41V19"><em>19</em> </a>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.<br />
    <a id="C41V20"><em>20</em> </a>Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.<br />
    <a id="C41V21"><em>21</em> </a>His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.<br />
    <a id="C41V22"><em>22</em> </a>In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.<br />
    <a id="C41V23"><em>23</em> </a>The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.<br />
    <a id="C41V24"><em>24</em> </a>His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.<br />
    <a id="C41V25"><em>25</em> </a>When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.<br />
    <a id="C41V26"><em>26</em> </a>The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.<br />
    <a id="C41V27"><em>27</em> </a>He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.<br />
    <a id="C41V28"><em>28</em> </a>The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.<br />
    <a id="C41V29"><em>29</em> </a>Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.<br />
    <a id="C41V30"><em>30</em> </a>Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.<br />
    <a id="C41V31"><em>31</em> </a>He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.<br />
    <a id="C41V32"><em>32</em> </a>He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.<br />
    <a id="C41V33"><em>33</em> </a>Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.<br />
    <a id="C41V34"><em>34</em> </a>He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-42"><a id="C42">Chapter 42</a></h2>
<p><a id="C42V1"><em>1</em> </a>Then Job answered the Lord , and said,<br />
    <a id="C42V2"><em>2</em> </a>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.<br />
    <a id="C42V3"><em>3</em> </a>Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.<br />
    <a id="C42V4"><em>4</em> </a>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.<br />
    <a id="C42V5"><em>5</em> </a>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.<br />
    <a id="C42V6"><em>6</em> </a>Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.<br />
    <a id="C42V7"><em>7</em> </a>And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.<br />
    <a id="C42V8"><em>8</em> </a>Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.<br />
    <a id="C42V9"><em>9</em> </a>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the Lord commanded them: the Lord also accepted Job.<br />
    <a id="C42V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.<br />
    <a id="C42V11"><em>11</em> </a>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.<br />
    <a id="C42V12"><em>12</em> </a>So the Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.<br />
    <a id="C42V13"><em>13</em> </a>He had also seven sons and three daughters.<br />
    <a id="C42V14"><em>14</em> </a>And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.<br />
    <a id="C42V15"><em>15</em> </a>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.<br />
    <a id="C42V16"><em>16</em> </a>After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.<br />
    <a id="C42V17"><em>17</em> </a>So Job died, being old and full of days.  </p></div>
