<h1 id="exodus">Exodus</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1"><a id="C1">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.<br />
    <a id="C1V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.<br />
    <a id="C1V7"><em>7</em> </a>And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.<br />
    <a id="C1V8"><em>8</em> </a>Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.<br />
    <a id="C1V9"><em>9</em> </a>And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:<br />
    <a id="C1V10"><em>10</em> </a>Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.<br />
    <a id="C1V11"><em>11</em> </a>Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.<br />
    <a id="C1V12"><em>12</em> </a>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C1V13"><em>13</em> </a>And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:<br />
    <a id="C1V14"><em>14</em> </a>And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.<br />
    <a id="C1V15"><em>15</em> </a>And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:<br />
    <a id="C1V16"><em>16</em> </a>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.<br />
    <a id="C1V17"><em>17</em> </a>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.<br />
    <a id="C1V18"><em>18</em> </a>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?<br />
    <a id="C1V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.<br />
    <a id="C1V20"><em>20</em> </a>Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.<br />
    <a id="C1V21"><em>21</em> </a>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.<br />
    <a id="C1V22"><em>22</em> </a>And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-2"><a id="C2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.<br />
    <a id="C2V5"><em>5</em> </a>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.<br />
    <a id="C2V6"><em>6</em> </a>And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.<br />
    <a id="C2V7"><em>7</em> </a>Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?<br />
    <a id="C2V8"><em>8</em> </a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.<br />
    <a id="C2V9"><em>9</em> </a>And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.<br />
    <a id="C2V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.<br />
    <a id="C2V11"><em>11</em> </a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.<br />
    <a id="C2V12"><em>12</em> </a>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<br />
    <a id="C2V13"><em>13</em> </a>And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?<br />
    <a id="C2V14"><em>14</em> </a>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.<br />
    <a id="C2V15"><em>15</em> </a>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.<br />
    <a id="C2V16"><em>16</em> </a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.<br />
    <a id="C2V17"><em>17</em> </a>And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.<br />
    <a id="C2V18"><em>18</em> </a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?<br />
    <a id="C2V19"><em>19</em> </a>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.<br />
    <a id="C2V20"><em>20</em> </a>And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.<br />
    <a id="C2V21"><em>21</em> </a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.<br />
    <a id="C2V22"><em>22</em> </a>And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.<br />
    <a id="C2V23"><em>23</em> </a>And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.<br />
    <a id="C2V24"><em>24</em> </a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.<br />
    <a id="C2V25"><em>25</em> </a>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-3"><a id="C3">Chapter 3</a></h2>
<p><a id="C3V1"><em>1</em> </a>Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.<br />
    <a id="C3V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.<br />
    <a id="C3V3"><em>3</em> </a>And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.<br />
    <a id="C3V4"><em>4</em> </a>And when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.<br />
    <a id="C3V5"><em>5</em> </a>And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.<br />
    <a id="C3V6"><em>6</em> </a>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.<br />
    <a id="C3V7"><em>7</em> </a>And the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;<br />
    <a id="C3V8"><em>8</em> </a>And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.<br />
    <a id="C3V9"><em>9</em> </a>Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.<br />
    <a id="C3V10"><em>10</em> </a>Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C3V11"><em>11</em> </a>And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?<br />
    <a id="C3V12"><em>12</em> </a>And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.<br />
    <a id="C3V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?<br />
    <a id="C3V14"><em>14</em> </a>And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am : and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.<br />
    <a id="C3V15"><em>15</em> </a>And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.<br />
    <a id="C3V16"><em>16</em> </a>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:<br />
    <a id="C3V17"><em>17</em> </a>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.<br />
    <a id="C3V18"><em>18</em> </a>And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.<br />
    <a id="C3V19"><em>19</em> </a>And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.<br />
    <a id="C3V20"><em>20</em> </a>And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.<br />
    <a id="C3V21"><em>21</em> </a>And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.<br />
    <a id="C3V22"><em>22</em> </a>But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-4"><a id="C4">Chapter 4</a></h2>
<p><a id="C4V1"><em>1</em> </a>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.<br />
    <a id="C4V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the Lord said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.<br />
    <a id="C4V3"><em>3</em> </a>And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.<br />
    <a id="C4V4"><em>4</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:<br />
    <a id="C4V5"><em>5</em> </a>That they may believe that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.<br />
    <a id="C4V6"><em>6</em> </a>And the Lord said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.<br />
    <a id="C4V7"><em>7</em> </a>And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.<br />
    <a id="C4V8"><em>8</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.<br />
    <a id="C4V9"><em>9</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.<br />
    <a id="C4V10"><em>10</em> </a>And Moses said unto the Lord , O my Lord , I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.<br />
    <a id="C4V11"><em>11</em> </a>And the Lord said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the Lord ?<br />

    <a id="C4V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.<br />

<p><a id="C5V1"><em>1</em> </a>And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.<br />

    <a id="C5V3"><em>3</em> </a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.<br />
    <a id="C5V4"><em>4</em> </a>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.<br />
    <a id="C5V5"><em>5</em> </a>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.<br />
    <a id="C5V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,<br />

    <a id="C5V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.<br />
    <a id="C5V9"><em>9</em> </a>Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.<br />
    <a id="C5V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.<br />
    <a id="C5V11"><em>11</em> </a>Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.<br />
    <a id="C5V12"><em>12</em> </a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.<br />
    <a id="C5V13"><em>13</em> </a>And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.<br />
    <a id="C5V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?<br />
    <a id="C5V15"><em>15</em> </a>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?<br />
    <a id="C5V16"><em>16</em> </a>There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.<br />
    <a id="C5V17"><em>17</em> </a>But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C5V18"><em>18</em> </a>Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.<br />
    <a id="C5V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.<br />
    <a id="C5V20"><em>20</em> </a>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:<br />
    <a id="C5V21"><em>21</em> </a>And they said unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.<br />
    <a id="C5V22"><em>22</em> </a>And Moses returned unto the Lord , and said, Lord , wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?<br />
    <a id="C5V23"><em>23</em> </a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.  </p>

    <a id="C9V12"><em>12</em> </a>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto Moses.<br />
    <a id="C9V13"><em>13</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.<br />
    <a id="C9V14"><em>14</em> </a>For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.<br />
    <a id="C9V15"><em>15</em> </a>For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.<br />
    <a id="C9V16"><em>16</em> </a>And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.<br />
    <a id="C9V17"><em>17</em> </a>As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?<br />
    <a id="C9V18"><em>18</em> </a>Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.<br />
    <a id="C9V19"><em>19</em> </a>Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.<br />
    <a id="C9V20"><em>20</em> </a>He that feared the word of the Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:<br />
    <a id="C9V21"><em>21</em> </a>And he that regarded not the word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field.<br />
    <a id="C9V22"><em>22</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C9V23"><em>23</em> </a>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C9V24"><em>24</em> </a>So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.<br />
    <a id="C9V25"><em>25</em> </a>And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.<br />
    <a id="C9V26"><em>26</em> </a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.<br />
    <a id="C9V27"><em>27</em> </a>And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.<br />
    <a id="C9V28"><em>28</em> </a>Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.<br />
    <a id="C9V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the Lord ; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord 's.<br />
    <a id="C9V30"><em>30</em> </a>But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.<br />
    <a id="C9V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.<br />
    <a id="C9V32"><em>32</em> </a>But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.<br />
    <a id="C9V33"><em>33</em> </a>And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord : and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.<br />
    <a id="C9V34"><em>34</em> </a>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.<br />
    <a id="C9V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the Lord had spoken by Moses.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-10"><a id="C10">Chapter 10</a></h2>
<p><a id="C10V1"><em>1</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:<br />
    <a id="C10V2"><em>2</em> </a>And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C10V3"><em>3</em> </a>And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.<br />
    <a id="C10V4"><em>4</em> </a>Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:<br />
    <a id="C10V5"><em>5</em> </a>And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:<br />
    <a id="C10V6"><em>6</em> </a>And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.<br />
    <a id="C10V7"><em>7</em> </a>And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the Lord their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?<br />
    <a id="C10V8"><em>8</em> </a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the Lord your God: but who are they that shall go?<br />
    <a id="C10V9"><em>9</em> </a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C10V10"><em>10</em> </a>And he said unto them, Let the Lord be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.<br />
    <a id="C10V11"><em>11</em> </a>Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the Lord ; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.<br />
    <a id="C10V12"><em>12</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.<br />
    <a id="C10V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.<br />
    <a id="C10V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.<br />
    <a id="C10V15"><em>15</em> </a>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C10V16"><em>16</em> </a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the Lord your God, and against you.<br />
    <a id="C10V17"><em>17</em> </a>Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the Lord your God, that he may take away from me this death only.<br />
    <a id="C10V18"><em>18</em> </a>And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C10V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the Lord turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C10V20"><em>20</em> </a>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.<br />
    <a id="C10V21"><em>21</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.<br />
    <a id="C10V22"><em>22</em> </a>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:<br />
    <a id="C10V23"><em>23</em> </a>They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.<br />
    <a id="C10V24"><em>24</em> </a>And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the Lord ; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.<br />
    <a id="C10V25"><em>25</em> </a>And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the Lord our God.<br />
    <a id="C10V26"><em>26</em> </a>Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the Lord our God; and we know not with what we must serve the Lord , until we come thither.<br />
    <a id="C10V27"><em>27</em> </a>But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.<br />
    <a id="C10V28"><em>28</em> </a>And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.<br />
    <a id="C10V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.  </p>

    <a id="C11V3"><em>3</em> </a>And the Lord gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.<br />

    <a id="C11V5"><em>5</em> </a>And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.<br />
    <a id="C11V6"><em>6</em> </a>And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.<br />
    <a id="C11V7"><em>7</em> </a>But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.<br />
    <a id="C11V8"><em>8</em> </a>And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.<br />
    <a id="C11V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C11V10"><em>10</em> </a>And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.  </p>

    <a id="C12V16"><em>16</em> </a>And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.<br />
    <a id="C12V17"><em>17</em> </a>And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.<br />
    <a id="C12V18"><em>18</em> </a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.<br />

    <a id="C13V18"><em>18</em> </a>But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C13V19"><em>19</em> </a>And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.<br />
    <a id="C13V20"><em>20</em> </a>And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.<br />
    <a id="C13V21"><em>21</em> </a>And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:<br />

<h2 id="chapter-14"><a id="C14">Chapter 14</a></h2>
<p><a id="C14V1"><em>1</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br />
    <a id="C14V2"><em>2</em> </a>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.<br />
    <a id="C14V3"><em>3</em> </a>For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.<br />
    <a id="C14V4"><em>4</em> </a>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord . And they did so.<br />
    <a id="C14V5"><em>5</em> </a>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?<br />
    <a id="C14V6"><em>6</em> </a>And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:<br />
    <a id="C14V7"><em>7</em> </a>And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.<br />
    <a id="C14V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.<br />
    <a id="C14V9"><em>9</em> </a>But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.<br />
    <a id="C14V10"><em>10</em> </a>And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C14V11"><em>11</em> </a>And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?<br />
    <a id="C14V12"><em>12</em> </a>Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.<br />
    <a id="C14V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord , which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.<br />
    <a id="C14V14"><em>14</em> </a>The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.<br />
    <a id="C14V15"><em>15</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:<br />

    <a id="C14V19"><em>19</em> </a>And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:<br />
    <a id="C14V20"><em>20</em> </a>And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.<br />
    <a id="C14V21"><em>21</em> </a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.<br />
    <a id="C14V22"><em>22</em> </a>And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<br />
    <a id="C14V23"><em>23</em> </a>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.<br />
    <a id="C14V24"><em>24</em> </a>And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,<br />
    <a id="C14V25"><em>25</em> </a>And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians.<br />
    <a id="C14V26"><em>26</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.<br />
    <a id="C14V27"><em>27</em> </a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.<br />
    <a id="C14V28"><em>28</em> </a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.<br />
    <a id="C14V29"><em>29</em> </a>But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.<br />
    <a id="C14V30"><em>30</em> </a>Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.<br />
    <a id="C14V31"><em>31</em> </a>And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the Lord , and believed the Lord , and his servant Moses.  </p>

    <a id="C15V18"><em>18</em> </a>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.<br />
    <a id="C15V19"><em>19</em> </a>For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.<br />
    <a id="C15V20"><em>20</em> </a>And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.<br />

    <a id="C15V22"><em>22</em> </a>So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.<br />
    <a id="C15V23"><em>23</em> </a>And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.<br />

    <a id="C15V25"><em>25</em> </a>And he cried unto the Lord ; and the Lord shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,<br />

<p><a id="C16V1"><em>1</em> </a>And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.<br />

    <a id="C16V3"><em>3</em> </a>And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.<br />
    <a id="C16V4"><em>4</em> </a>Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.<br />
    <a id="C16V5"><em>5</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.<br />
    <a id="C16V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the Lord hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:<br />
    <a id="C16V7"><em>7</em> </a>And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the Lord ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the Lord : and what are we, that ye murmur against us?<br />
    <a id="C16V8"><em>8</em> </a>And Moses said, This shall be, when the Lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the Lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C16V9"><em>9</em> </a>And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the Lord : for he hath heard your murmurings.<br />
    <a id="C16V10"><em>10</em> </a>And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.<br />
    <a id="C16V11"><em>11</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br />
    <a id="C16V12"><em>12</em> </a>I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.<br />
    <a id="C16V13"><em>13</em> </a>And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.<br />
    <a id="C16V14"><em>14</em> </a>And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.<br />
    <a id="C16V15"><em>15</em> </a>And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.<br />
    <a id="C16V16"><em>16</em> </a>This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.<br />
    <a id="C16V17"><em>17</em> </a>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.<br />
    <a id="C16V18"><em>18</em> </a>And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.<br />
    <a id="C16V19"><em>19</em> </a>And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.<br />
    <a id="C16V20"><em>20</em> </a>Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.<br />
    <a id="C16V21"><em>21</em> </a>And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.<br />
    <a id="C16V22"><em>22</em> </a>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.<br />
    <a id="C16V23"><em>23</em> </a>And he said unto them, This is that which the Lord hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the Lord : bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.<br />
    <a id="C16V24"><em>24</em> </a>And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.<br />
    <a id="C16V25"><em>25</em> </a>And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the Lord : to day ye shall not find it in the field.<br />
    <a id="C16V26"><em>26</em> </a>Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.<br />
    <a id="C16V27"><em>27</em> </a>And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.<br />
    <a id="C16V28"><em>28</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?<br />
    <a id="C16V29"><em>29</em> </a>See, for that the Lord hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.<br />
    <a id="C16V30"><em>30</em> </a>So the people rested on the seventh day.<br />
    <a id="C16V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.<br />
    <a id="C16V32"><em>32</em> </a>And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C16V33"><em>33</em> </a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the Lord , to be kept for your generations.<br />
    <a id="C16V34"><em>34</em> </a>As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.<br />
    <a id="C16V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.<br />
    <a id="C16V36"><em>36</em> </a>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.  </p>

    <a id="C17V3"><em>3</em> </a>And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?<br />
    <a id="C17V4"><em>4</em> </a>And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.<br />
    <a id="C17V5"><em>5</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.<br />
    <a id="C17V6"><em>6</em> </a>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C17V7"><em>7</em> </a>And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord , saying, Is the Lord among us, or not?<br />

    <a id="C17V10"><em>10</em> </a>So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.<br />
    <a id="C17V11"><em>11</em> </a>And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.<br />
    <a id="C17V12"><em>12</em> </a>But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.<br />
    <a id="C17V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.<br />
    <a id="C17V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.<br />

    <a id="C18V19"><em>19</em> </a>Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:<br />
    <a id="C18V20"><em>20</em> </a>And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.<br />
    <a id="C18V21"><em>21</em> </a>Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:<br />
    <a id="C18V22"><em>22</em> </a>And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.<br />
    <a id="C18V23"><em>23</em> </a>If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.<br />
    <a id="C18V24"><em>24</em> </a>So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.<br />
    <a id="C18V25"><em>25</em> </a>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.<br />
    <a id="C18V26"><em>26</em> </a>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.<br />
    <a id="C18V27"><em>27</em> </a>And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-19"><a id="C19">Chapter 19</a></h2>
<p><a id="C19V1"><em>1</em> </a>In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.<br />
    <a id="C19V2"><em>2</em> </a>For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.<br />
    <a id="C19V3"><em>3</em> </a>And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;<br />
    <a id="C19V4"><em>4</em> </a>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.<br />
    <a id="C19V5"><em>5</em> </a>Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:<br />
    <a id="C19V6"><em>6</em> </a>And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C19V7"><em>7</em> </a>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him.<br />
    <a id="C19V8"><em>8</em> </a>And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C19V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C19V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,<br />
    <a id="C19V11"><em>11</em> </a>And be ready against the third day: for the third day the Lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.<br />
    <a id="C19V12"><em>12</em> </a>And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:<br />
    <a id="C19V13"><em>13</em> </a>There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.<br />
    <a id="C19V14"><em>14</em> </a>And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.<br />
    <a id="C19V15"><em>15</em> </a>And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.<br />
    <a id="C19V16"><em>16</em> </a>And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.<br />
    <a id="C19V17"><em>17</em> </a>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.<br />
    <a id="C19V18"><em>18</em> </a>And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.<br />
    <a id="C19V19"><em>19</em> </a>And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.<br />
    <a id="C19V20"><em>20</em> </a>And the Lord came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.<br />
    <a id="C19V21"><em>21</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze, and many of them perish.<br />
    <a id="C19V22"><em>22</em> </a>And let the priests also, which come near to the Lord , sanctify themselves, lest the Lord break forth upon them.<br />
    <a id="C19V23"><em>23</em> </a>And Moses said unto the Lord , The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.<br />
    <a id="C19V24"><em>24</em> </a>And the Lord said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them.<br />
    <a id="C19V25"><em>25</em> </a>So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-20"><a id="C20">Chapter 20</a></h2>
<p><a id="C20V1"><em>1</em> </a>And God spake all these words, saying,<br />

    <a id="C20V4"><em>4</em> </a>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.<br />
    <a id="C20V5"><em>5</em> </a>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;<br />

    <a id="C20V7"><em>7</em> </a>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.<br />
    <a id="C20V8"><em>8</em> </a>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.<br />
    <a id="C20V9"><em>9</em> </a>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:<br />

    <a id="C20V11"><em>11</em> </a>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.<br />
    <a id="C20V12"><em>12</em> </a>Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<br />
    <a id="C20V13"><em>13</em> </a>Thou shalt not kill.<br />
    <a id="C20V14"><em>14</em> </a>Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br />

    <a id="C20V18"><em>18</em> </a>And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.<br />
    <a id="C20V19"><em>19</em> </a>And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.<br />
    <a id="C20V20"><em>20</em> </a>And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.<br />
    <a id="C20V21"><em>21</em> </a>And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.<br />
    <a id="C20V22"><em>22</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.<br />

    <a id="C21V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.<br />
    <a id="C21V7"><em>7</em> </a>And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.<br />
    <a id="C21V8"><em>8</em> </a>If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.<br />
    <a id="C21V9"><em>9</em> </a>And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.<br />
    <a id="C21V10"><em>10</em> </a>If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.<br />

    <a id="C21V16"><em>16</em> </a>And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.<br />

    <a id="C32V2"><em>2</em> </a>And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.<br />
    <a id="C32V3"><em>3</em> </a>And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.<br />
    <a id="C32V4"><em>4</em> </a>And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C32V5"><em>5</em> </a>And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C32V6"><em>6</em> </a>And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.<br />
    <a id="C32V7"><em>7</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:<br />
    <a id="C32V8"><em>8</em> </a>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.<br />
    <a id="C32V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<br />
    <a id="C32V10"><em>10</em> </a>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.<br />
    <a id="C32V11"><em>11</em> </a>And Moses besought the Lord his God, and said, Lord , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?<br />
    <a id="C32V12"><em>12</em> </a>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.<br />
    <a id="C32V13"><em>13</em> </a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.<br />
    <a id="C32V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.<br />
    <a id="C32V15"><em>15</em> </a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.<br />
    <a id="C32V16"><em>16</em> </a>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.<br />
    <a id="C32V17"><em>17</em> </a>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.<br />
    <a id="C32V18"><em>18</em> </a>And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.<br />
    <a id="C32V19"><em>19</em> </a>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.<br />
    <a id="C32V20"><em>20</em> </a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.<br />
    <a id="C32V21"><em>21</em> </a>And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?<br />
    <a id="C32V22"><em>22</em> </a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.<br />
    <a id="C32V23"><em>23</em> </a>For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.<br />
    <a id="C32V24"><em>24</em> </a>And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.<br />
    <a id="C32V25"><em>25</em> </a>And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)<br />
    <a id="C32V26"><em>26</em> </a>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the Lord 's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.<br />
    <a id="C32V27"><em>27</em> </a>And he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.<br />
    <a id="C32V28"><em>28</em> </a>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.<br />
    <a id="C32V29"><em>29</em> </a>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord , even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.<br />
    <a id="C32V30"><em>30</em> </a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the Lord ; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.<br />
    <a id="C32V31"><em>31</em> </a>And Moses returned unto the Lord , and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.<br />
    <a id="C32V32"><em>32</em> </a>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.<br />
    <a id="C32V33"><em>33</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.<br />
    <a id="C32V34"><em>34</em> </a>Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.<br />
    <a id="C32V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the Lord plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-33"><a id="C33">Chapter 33</a></h2>
<p><a id="C33V1"><em>1</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:<br />
    <a id="C33V2"><em>2</em> </a>And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:<br />
    <a id="C33V3"><em>3</em> </a>Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way.<br />
    <a id="C33V4"><em>4</em> </a>And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.<br />
    <a id="C33V5"><em>5</em> </a>For the Lord had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.<br />
    <a id="C33V6"><em>6</em> </a>And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.<br />
    <a id="C33V7"><em>7</em> </a>And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the Lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.<br />
    <a id="C33V8"><em>8</em> </a>And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C33V9"><em>9</em> </a>And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.<br />
    <a id="C33V10"><em>10</em> </a>And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.<br />
    <a id="C33V11"><em>11</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C33V12"><em>12</em> </a>And Moses said unto the Lord , See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.<br />
    <a id="C33V13"><em>13</em> </a>Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.<br />
    <a id="C33V14"><em>14</em> </a>And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.<br />
    <a id="C33V15"><em>15</em> </a>And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.<br />
    <a id="C33V16"><em>16</em> </a>For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.<br />
    <a id="C33V17"><em>17</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.<br />
    <a id="C33V18"><em>18</em> </a>And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.<br />
    <a id="C33V19"><em>19</em> </a>And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy.<br />
    <a id="C33V20"><em>20</em> </a>And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.<br />
    <a id="C33V21"><em>21</em> </a>And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock:<br />
    <a id="C33V22"><em>22</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by:<br />
    <a id="C33V23"><em>23</em> </a>And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-34"><a id="C34">Chapter 34</a></h2>
<p><a id="C34V1"><em>1</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.<br />
    <a id="C34V2"><em>2</em> </a>And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.<br />
    <a id="C34V3"><em>3</em> </a>And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.<br />
    <a id="C34V4"><em>4</em> </a>And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.<br />
    <a id="C34V5"><em>5</em> </a>And the Lord descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C34V6"><em>6</em> </a>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord , The Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,<br />
    <a id="C34V7"><em>7</em> </a>Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.<br />
    <a id="C34V8"><em>8</em> </a>And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.<br />
    <a id="C34V9"><em>9</em> </a>And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.<br />
    <a id="C34V10"><em>10</em> </a>And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the Lord : for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.<br />
    <a id="C34V11"><em>11</em> </a>Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.<br />

    <a id="C34V29"><em>29</em> </a>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.<br />

    <a id="C34V31"><em>31</em> </a>And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them.<br />
    <a id="C34V32"><em>32</em> </a>And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in mount Sinai.<br />
    <a id="C34V33"><em>33</em> </a>And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.<br />

    <a id="C34V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.  </p>

    <a id="C40V12"><em>12</em> </a>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.<br />
    <a id="C40V13"><em>13</em> </a>And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.<br />
    <a id="C40V14"><em>14</em> </a>And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:<br />
    <a id="C40V15"><em>15</em> </a>And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.<br />
    <a id="C40V16"><em>16</em> </a>Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he.<br />
    <a id="C40V17"><em>17</em> </a>And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.<br />
    <a id="C40V18"><em>18</em> </a>And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars.<br />
    <a id="C40V19"><em>19</em> </a>And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V20"><em>20</em> </a>And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:<br />
    <a id="C40V21"><em>21</em> </a>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V22"><em>22</em> </a>And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.<br />
    <a id="C40V23"><em>23</em> </a>And he set the bread in order upon it before the Lord ; as the Lord had commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V24"><em>24</em> </a>And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.<br />
    <a id="C40V25"><em>25</em> </a>And he lighted the lamps before the Lord ; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V26"><em>26</em> </a>And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail:<br />
    <a id="C40V27"><em>27</em> </a>And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V28"><em>28</em> </a>And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C40V29"><em>29</em> </a>And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V30"><em>30</em> </a>And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.<br />
    <a id="C40V31"><em>31</em> </a>And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat:<br />
    <a id="C40V32"><em>32</em> </a>When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C40V33"><em>33</em> </a>And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.<br />
    <a id="C40V34"><em>34</em> </a>Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C40V35"><em>35</em> </a>And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C40V36"><em>36</em> </a>And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:<br />
    <a id="C40V37"><em>37</em> </a>But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.<br />
    <a id="C40V38"><em>38</em> </a>For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.  </p></div>
