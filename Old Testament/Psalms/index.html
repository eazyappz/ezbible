<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>But his delight is in the law of the Lord ; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br />

<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord , and against his anointed, saying,<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.<br />
    <a id="C2V5"><em>5</em> </a>Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.<br />
    <a id="C2V6"><em>6</em> </a>Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.<br />
    <a id="C2V7"><em>7</em> </a>I will declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.<br />
    <a id="C2V8"><em>8</em> </a>Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.<br />
    <a id="C2V9"><em>9</em> </a>Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.<br />
    <a id="C2V10"><em>10</em> </a>Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.<br />
    <a id="C2V11"><em>11</em> </a>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.<br />

    <a id="C3V3"><em>3</em> </a>But thou, O Lord , art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.<br />
    <a id="C3V4"><em>4</em> </a>I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.<br />
    <a id="C3V5"><em>5</em> </a>I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the Lord sustained me.<br />

    <a id="C78V3"><em>3</em> </a>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.<br />
    <a id="C78V4"><em>4</em> </a>We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord , and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.<br />
    <a id="C78V5"><em>5</em> </a>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:<br />
    <a id="C78V6"><em>6</em> </a>That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:<br />
    <a id="C78V7"><em>7</em> </a>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:<br />
    <a id="C78V8"><em>8</em> </a>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.<br />
    <a id="C78V9"><em>9</em> </a>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.<br />
    <a id="C78V10"><em>10</em> </a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;<br />
    <a id="C78V11"><em>11</em> </a>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.<br />
    <a id="C78V12"><em>12</em> </a>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br />
    <a id="C78V13"><em>13</em> </a>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.<br />
    <a id="C78V14"><em>14</em> </a>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.<br />
    <a id="C78V15"><em>15</em> </a>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.<br />
    <a id="C78V16"><em>16</em> </a>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br />
    <a id="C78V17"><em>17</em> </a>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.<br />
    <a id="C78V18"><em>18</em> </a>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.<br />
    <a id="C78V19"><em>19</em> </a>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?<br />
    <a id="C78V20"><em>20</em> </a>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?<br />
    <a id="C78V21"><em>21</em> </a>Therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;<br />
    <a id="C78V22"><em>22</em> </a>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:<br />
    <a id="C78V23"><em>23</em> </a>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,<br />
    <a id="C78V24"><em>24</em> </a>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.<br />
    <a id="C78V25"><em>25</em> </a>Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.<br />
    <a id="C78V26"><em>26</em> </a>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.<br />
    <a id="C78V27"><em>27</em> </a>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:<br />
    <a id="C78V28"><em>28</em> </a>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.<br />
    <a id="C78V29"><em>29</em> </a>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;<br />
    <a id="C78V30"><em>30</em> </a>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,<br />
    <a id="C78V31"><em>31</em> </a>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C78V32"><em>32</em> </a>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.<br />
    <a id="C78V33"><em>33</em> </a>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.<br />
    <a id="C78V34"><em>34</em> </a>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.<br />
    <a id="C78V35"><em>35</em> </a>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.<br />
    <a id="C78V36"><em>36</em> </a>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.<br />
    <a id="C78V37"><em>37</em> </a>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.<br />
    <a id="C78V38"><em>38</em> </a>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.<br />
    <a id="C78V39"><em>39</em> </a>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.<br />
    <a id="C78V40"><em>40</em> </a>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!<br />
    <a id="C78V41"><em>41</em> </a>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C78V42"><em>42</em> </a>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.<br />
    <a id="C78V43"><em>43</em> </a>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.<br />
    <a id="C78V44"><em>44</em> </a>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.<br />
    <a id="C78V45"><em>45</em> </a>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.<br />
    <a id="C78V46"><em>46</em> </a>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.<br />
    <a id="C78V47"><em>47</em> </a>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.<br />
    <a id="C78V48"><em>48</em> </a>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br />
    <a id="C78V49"><em>49</em> </a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.<br />
    <a id="C78V50"><em>50</em> </a>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;<br />
    <a id="C78V51"><em>51</em> </a>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:<br />
    <a id="C78V52"><em>52</em> </a>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br />
    <a id="C78V53"><em>53</em> </a>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br />
    <a id="C78V54"><em>54</em> </a>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.<br />
    <a id="C78V55"><em>55</em> </a>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br />
    <a id="C78V56"><em>56</em> </a>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:<br />
    <a id="C78V57"><em>57</em> </a>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br />
    <a id="C78V58"><em>58</em> </a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.<br />
    <a id="C78V59"><em>59</em> </a>When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:<br />
    <a id="C78V60"><em>60</em> </a>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;<br />
    <a id="C78V61"><em>61</em> </a>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.<br />
    <a id="C78V62"><em>62</em> </a>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.<br />
    <a id="C78V63"><em>63</em> </a>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.<br />
    <a id="C78V64"><em>64</em> </a>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.<br />
    <a id="C78V65"><em>65</em> </a>Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.<br />
    <a id="C78V66"><em>66</em> </a>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.<br />
    <a id="C78V67"><em>67</em> </a>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:<br />
    <a id="C78V68"><em>68</em> </a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.<br />
    <a id="C78V69"><em>69</em> </a>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.<br />
    <a id="C78V70"><em>70</em> </a>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:<br />
    <a id="C78V71"><em>71</em> </a>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.<br />
    <a id="C78V72"><em>72</em> </a>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.  </p>
