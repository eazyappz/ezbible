    <a id="C10V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.<br />

    <a id="C11V3"><em>3</em> </a>And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the Lord burnt among them.<br />
    <a id="C11V4"><em>4</em> </a>And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?<br />
    <a id="C11V5"><em>5</em> </a>We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick:<br />
    <a id="C11V6"><em>6</em> </a>But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.<br />
    <a id="C11V7"><em>7</em> </a>And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.<br />
    <a id="C11V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.<br />
    <a id="C11V9"><em>9</em> </a>And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.<br />
    <a id="C11V10"><em>10</em> </a>Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.<br />
    <a id="C11V11"><em>11</em> </a>And Moses said unto the Lord , Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?<br />
    <a id="C11V12"><em>12</em> </a>Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<br />
    <a id="C11V13"><em>13</em> </a>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.<br />
    <a id="C11V14"><em>14</em> </a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.<br />
    <a id="C11V15"><em>15</em> </a>And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.<br />
    <a id="C11V16"><em>16</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee.<br />
    <a id="C11V17"><em>17</em> </a>And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.<br />
    <a id="C11V18"><em>18</em> </a>And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord , saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.<br />
    <a id="C11V19"><em>19</em> </a>Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;<br />
    <a id="C11V20"><em>20</em> </a>But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?<br />
    <a id="C11V21"><em>21</em> </a>And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.<br />
    <a id="C11V22"><em>22</em> </a>Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?<br />
    <a id="C11V23"><em>23</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord 'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.<br />
    <a id="C11V24"><em>24</em> </a>And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Lord , and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.<br />
    <a id="C11V25"><em>25</em> </a>And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.<br />
    <a id="C11V26"><em>26</em> </a>But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.<br />
    <a id="C11V27"><em>27</em> </a>And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.<br />
    <a id="C11V28"><em>28</em> </a>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.<br />
    <a id="C11V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the Lord 'S people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!<br />
    <a id="C11V30"><em>30</em> </a>And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C11V31"><em>31</em> </a>And there went forth a wind from the Lord , and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.<br />
    <a id="C11V32"><em>32</em> </a>And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.<br />
    <a id="C11V33"><em>33</em> </a>And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with a very great plague.<br />
    <a id="C11V34"><em>34</em> </a>And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.<br />
    <a id="C11V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.  </p>

    <a id="C12V3"><em>3</em> </a>(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)<br />

    <a id="C12V5"><em>5</em> </a>And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.<br />
    <a id="C12V6"><em>6</em> </a>And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.<br />
    <a id="C12V7"><em>7</em> </a>My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.<br />
    <a id="C12V8"><em>8</em> </a>With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?<br />
    <a id="C12V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed.<br />
    <a id="C12V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.<br />
    <a id="C12V11"><em>11</em> </a>And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.<br />
    <a id="C12V12"><em>12</em> </a>Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.<br />
    <a id="C12V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee.<br />
    <a id="C12V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.<br />
    <a id="C12V15"><em>15</em> </a>And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.<br />
    <a id="C12V16"><em>16</em> </a>And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.  </p>

    <a id="C13V33"><em>33</em> </a>And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.  </p>

    <a id="C14V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:<br />
    <a id="C14V7"><em>7</em> </a>And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.<br />

    <a id="C22V21"><em>21</em> </a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.<br />
    <a id="C22V22"><em>22</em> </a>And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.<br />
    <a id="C22V23"><em>23</em> </a>And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.<br />
    <a id="C22V24"><em>24</em> </a>But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.<br />
    <a id="C22V25"><em>25</em> </a>And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again.<br />
    <a id="C22V26"><em>26</em> </a>And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.<br />
    <a id="C22V27"><em>27</em> </a>And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord , she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.<br />
    <a id="C22V28"><em>28</em> </a>And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?<br />
    <a id="C22V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.<br />
    <a id="C22V30"><em>30</em> </a>And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? and he said, Nay.<br />
    <a id="C22V31"><em>31</em> </a>Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.<br />
    <a id="C22V32"><em>32</em> </a>And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:<br />
    <a id="C22V33"><em>33</em> </a>And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.<br />
    <a id="C22V34"><em>34</em> </a>And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord , I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.<br />
    <a id="C22V35"><em>35</em> </a>And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.<br />
    <a id="C22V36"><em>36</em> </a>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.<br />
    <a id="C22V37"><em>37</em> </a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?<br />
    <a id="C22V38"><em>38</em> </a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.<br />
    <a id="C22V39"><em>39</em> </a>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.<br />
    <a id="C22V40"><em>40</em> </a>And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.<br />
    <a id="C22V41"><em>41</em> </a>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-23"><a id="C23">Chapter 23</a></h2>
<p><a id="C23V1"><em>1</em> </a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.<br />

    <a id="C23V3"><em>3</em> </a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the Lord will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.<br />
    <a id="C23V4"><em>4</em> </a>And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.<br />
    <a id="C23V5"><em>5</em> </a>And the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.<br />
    <a id="C23V6"><em>6</em> </a>And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.<br />
    <a id="C23V7"><em>7</em> </a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.<br />
    <a id="C23V8"><em>8</em> </a>How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the Lord hath not defied?<br />
    <a id="C23V9"><em>9</em> </a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.<br />
    <a id="C23V10"><em>10</em> </a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!<br />
    <a id="C23V11"><em>11</em> </a>And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.<br />
    <a id="C23V12"><em>12</em> </a>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put in my mouth?<br />
    <a id="C23V13"><em>13</em> </a>And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.<br />
    <a id="C23V14"><em>14</em> </a>And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.<br />
    <a id="C23V15"><em>15</em> </a>And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the Lord yonder.<br />
    <a id="C23V16"><em>16</em> </a>And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.<br />
    <a id="C23V17"><em>17</em> </a>And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the Lord spoken?<br />
    <a id="C23V18"><em>18</em> </a>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:<br />
    <a id="C23V19"><em>19</em> </a>God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?<br />

    <a id="C23V21"><em>21</em> </a>He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of a king is among them.<br />
    <a id="C23V22"><em>22</em> </a>God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn.<br />
    <a id="C23V23"><em>23</em> </a>Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!<br />

    <a id="C23V25"><em>25</em> </a>And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.<br />
    <a id="C23V26"><em>26</em> </a>But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?<br />

    <a id="C23V30"><em>30</em> </a>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.  </p>

<p><a id="C24V1"><em>1</em> </a>And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.<br />
    <a id="C24V2"><em>2</em> </a>And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.<br />
    <a id="C24V3"><em>3</em> </a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<br />

    <a id="C24V6"><em>6</em> </a>As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the Lord hath planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.<br />

    <a id="C24V9"><em>9</em> </a>He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.<br />
    <a id="C24V10"><em>10</em> </a>And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.<br />
    <a id="C24V11"><em>11</em> </a>Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honour.<br />
    <a id="C24V12"><em>12</em> </a>And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C24V13"><em>13</em> </a>If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord , to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak?<br />
    <a id="C24V14"><em>14</em> </a>And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.<br />
    <a id="C24V15"><em>15</em> </a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:<br />

    <a id="C24V18"><em>18</em> </a>And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.<br />

    <a id="C24V20"><em>20</em> </a>And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.<br />
    <a id="C24V21"><em>21</em> </a>And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.<br />

    <a id="C25V3"><em>3</em> </a>And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.<br />

    <a id="C25V6"><em>6</em> </a>And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<br />

    <a id="C32V2"><em>2</em> </a>The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,<br />
    <a id="C32V3"><em>3</em> </a>Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,<br />
    <a id="C32V4"><em>4</em> </a>Even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:<br />
    <a id="C32V5"><em>5</em> </a>Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.<br />
    <a id="C32V6"><em>6</em> </a>And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?<br />

    <a id="C32V8"><em>8</em> </a>Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.<br />
    <a id="C32V9"><em>9</em> </a>For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the Lord had given them.<br />
    <a id="C32V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the Lord 'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,<br />

    <a id="C32V13"><em>13</em> </a>And the Lord 'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the Lord , was consumed.<br />
    <a id="C32V14"><em>14</em> </a>And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.<br />
    <a id="C32V15"><em>15</em> </a>For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.<br />
    <a id="C32V16"><em>16</em> </a>And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:<br />

    <a id="C32V24"><em>24</em> </a>Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.<br />
    <a id="C32V25"><em>25</em> </a>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.<br />

    <a id="C32V28"><em>28</em> </a>So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:<br />
    <a id="C32V29"><em>29</em> </a>And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the Lord , and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:<br />
    <a id="C32V30"><em>30</em> </a>But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.<br />
    <a id="C32V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.<br />
    <a id="C32V32"><em>32</em> </a>We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be our's.<br />
    <a id="C32V33"><em>33</em> </a>And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.<br />
    <a id="C32V34"><em>34</em> </a>And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,<br />

    <a id="C32V38"><em>38</em> </a>And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.<br />
    <a id="C32V39"><em>39</em> </a>And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.<br />

    <a id="C35V6"><em>6</em> </a>And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities.<br />

    <a id="C35V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,<br />

    <a id="C35V11"><em>11</em> </a>Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares.<br />
    <a id="C35V12"><em>12</em> </a>And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment.<br />

    <a id="C35V14"><em>14</em> </a>Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.<br />

    <a id="C35V26"><em>26</em> </a>But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;<br />

    <a id="C35V29"><em>29</em> </a>So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.<br />
    <a id="C35V30"><em>30</em> </a>Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.<br />
    <a id="C35V31"><em>31</em> </a>Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.<br />
    <a id="C35V32"><em>32</em> </a>And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.<br />
    <a id="C35V33"><em>33</em> </a>So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.<br />

<p><a id="C36V1"><em>1</em> </a>And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:<br />
    <a id="C36V2"><em>2</em> </a>And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.<br />
    <a id="C36V3"><em>3</em> </a>And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.<br />
    <a id="C36V4"><em>4</em> </a>And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.<br />

    <a id="C36V10"><em>10</em> </a>Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:<br />
    <a id="C36V11"><em>11</em> </a>For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fathers brothers' sons:<br />
    <a id="C36V12"><em>12</em> </a>And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.<br />
    <a id="C36V13"><em>13</em> </a>These are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.  </p></div>
