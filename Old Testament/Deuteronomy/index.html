<h1 id="deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1"><a id="C1">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>(There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them;<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,<br />
    <a id="C1V6"><em>6</em> </a>The Lord our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:<br />
    <a id="C1V7"><em>7</em> </a>Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.<br />
    <a id="C1V8"><em>8</em> </a>Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.<br />
    <a id="C1V9"><em>9</em> </a>And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:<br />
    <a id="C1V10"><em>10</em> </a>The Lord your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.<br />
    <a id="C1V11"><em>11</em> </a>(The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)<br />
    <a id="C1V12"><em>12</em> </a>How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?<br />
    <a id="C1V13"><em>13</em> </a>Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.<br />
    <a id="C1V14"><em>14</em> </a>And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.<br />
    <a id="C1V15"><em>15</em> </a>So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.<br />
    <a id="C1V16"><em>16</em> </a>And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.<br />
    <a id="C1V17"><em>17</em> </a>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.<br />
    <a id="C1V18"><em>18</em> </a>And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.<br />
    <a id="C1V19"><em>19</em> </a>And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.<br />
    <a id="C1V20"><em>20</em> </a>And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the Lord our God doth give unto us.<br />
    <a id="C1V21"><em>21</em> </a>Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.<br />
    <a id="C1V22"><em>22</em> </a>And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.<br />
    <a id="C1V23"><em>23</em> </a>And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:<br />
    <a id="C1V24"><em>24</em> </a>And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.<br />
    <a id="C1V25"><em>25</em> </a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which the Lord our God doth give us.<br />
    <a id="C1V26"><em>26</em> </a>Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God:<br />
    <a id="C1V27"><em>27</em> </a>And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.<br />
    <a id="C1V28"><em>28</em> </a>Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.<br />
    <a id="C1V29"><em>29</em> </a>Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.<br />
    <a id="C1V30"><em>30</em> </a>The Lord your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;<br />
    <a id="C1V31"><em>31</em> </a>And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.<br />
    <a id="C1V32"><em>32</em> </a>Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,<br />
    <a id="C1V33"><em>33</em> </a>Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.<br />
    <a id="C1V34"><em>34</em> </a>And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,<br />
    <a id="C1V35"><em>35</em> </a>Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers.<br />
    <a id="C1V36"><em>36</em> </a>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C1V37"><em>37</em> </a>Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.<br />
    <a id="C1V38"><em>38</em> </a>But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.<br />
    <a id="C1V39"><em>39</em> </a>Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.<br />
    <a id="C1V40"><em>40</em> </a>But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.<br />
    <a id="C1V41"><em>41</em> </a>Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord , we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.<br />
    <a id="C1V42"><em>42</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.<br />
    <a id="C1V43"><em>43</em> </a>So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the Lord , and went presumptuously up into the hill.<br />
    <a id="C1V44"><em>44</em> </a>And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.<br />
    <a id="C1V45"><em>45</em> </a>And ye returned and wept before the Lord ; but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.<br />
    <a id="C1V46"><em>46</em> </a>So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-2"><a id="C2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the Lord spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:<br />
    <a id="C2V5"><em>5</em> </a>Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession.<br />
    <a id="C2V6"><em>6</em> </a>Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.<br />
    <a id="C2V7"><em>7</em> </a>For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.<br />
    <a id="C2V8"><em>8</em> </a>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.<br />
    <a id="C2V9"><em>9</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br />
    <a id="C2V10"><em>10</em> </a>The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;<br />
    <a id="C2V11"><em>11</em> </a>Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.<br />
    <a id="C2V12"><em>12</em> </a>The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the Lord gave unto them.<br />
    <a id="C2V13"><em>13</em> </a>Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.<br />
    <a id="C2V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the Lord sware unto them.<br />
    <a id="C2V15"><em>15</em> </a>For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.<br />
    <a id="C2V16"><em>16</em> </a>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,<br />
    <a id="C2V17"><em>17</em> </a>That the Lord spake unto me, saying,<br />
    <a id="C2V18"><em>18</em> </a>Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:<br />
    <a id="C2V19"><em>19</em> </a>And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.<br />
    <a id="C2V20"><em>20</em> </a>(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;<br />
    <a id="C2V21"><em>21</em> </a>A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:<br />
    <a id="C2V22"><em>22</em> </a>As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:<br />
    <a id="C2V23"><em>23</em> </a>And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)<br />
    <a id="C2V24"><em>24</em> </a>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.<br />
    <a id="C2V25"><em>25</em> </a>This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.<br />
    <a id="C2V26"><em>26</em> </a>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,<br />
    <a id="C2V27"><em>27</em> </a>Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.<br />
    <a id="C2V28"><em>28</em> </a>Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;<br />
    <a id="C2V29"><em>29</em> </a>(As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the Lord our God giveth us.<br />
    <a id="C2V30"><em>30</em> </a>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.<br />
    <a id="C2V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.<br />
    <a id="C2V32"><em>32</em> </a>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.<br />
    <a id="C2V33"><em>33</em> </a>And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.<br />
    <a id="C2V34"><em>34</em> </a>And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:<br />
    <a id="C2V35"><em>35</em> </a>Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.<br />
    <a id="C2V36"><em>36</em> </a>From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us:<br />
    <a id="C2V37"><em>37</em> </a>Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbad us.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-3"><a id="C3">Chapter 3</a></h2>
<p><a id="C3V1"><em>1</em> </a>Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.<br />
    <a id="C3V2"><em>2</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.<br />
    <a id="C3V3"><em>3</em> </a>So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.<br />
    <a id="C3V4"><em>4</em> </a>And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.<br />
    <a id="C3V5"><em>5</em> </a>All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.<br />
    <a id="C3V6"><em>6</em> </a>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.<br />
    <a id="C3V7"><em>7</em> </a>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.<br />
    <a id="C3V8"><em>8</em> </a>And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;<br />

    <a id="C3V12"><em>12</em> </a>And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.<br />

    <a id="C3V25"><em>25</em> </a>I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.<br />
    <a id="C3V26"><em>26</em> </a>But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.<br />
    <a id="C3V27"><em>27</em> </a>Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.<br />
    <a id="C3V28"><em>28</em> </a>But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.<br />

    <a id="C4V13"><em>13</em> </a>And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.<br />
    <a id="C4V14"><em>14</em> </a>And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it.<br />
    <a id="C4V15"><em>15</em> </a>Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:<br />
    <a id="C4V16"><em>16</em> </a>Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,<br />

    <a id="C4V19"><em>19</em> </a>And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.<br />
    <a id="C4V20"><em>20</em> </a>But the Lord hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as ye are this day.<br />
    <a id="C4V21"><em>21</em> </a>Furthermore the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance:<br />
    <a id="C4V22"><em>22</em> </a>But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.<br />
    <a id="C4V23"><em>23</em> </a>Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the Lord thy God hath forbidden thee.<br />

    <a id="C4V26"><em>26</em> </a>I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.<br />

    <a id="C4V29"><em>29</em> </a>But if from thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.<br />
    <a id="C4V30"><em>30</em> </a>When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;<br />

    <a id="C4V32"><em>32</em> </a>For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?<br />
    <a id="C4V33"><em>33</em> </a>Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?<br />
    <a id="C4V34"><em>34</em> </a>Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?<br />
    <a id="C4V35"><em>35</em> </a>Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the Lord he is God; there is none else beside him.<br />
    <a id="C4V36"><em>36</em> </a>Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.<br />
    <a id="C4V37"><em>37</em> </a>And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;<br />
    <a id="C4V38"><em>38</em> </a>To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.<br />
    <a id="C4V39"><em>39</em> </a>Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.<br />
    <a id="C4V40"><em>40</em> </a>Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, for ever.<br />

    <a id="C5V15"><em>15</em> </a>And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.<br />

    <a id="C9V3"><em>3</em> </a>Understand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the Lord hath said unto thee.<br />
    <a id="C9V4"><em>4</em> </a>Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the Lord hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the Lord doth drive them out from before thee.<br />

    <a id="C9V6"><em>6</em> </a>Understand therefore, that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.<br />
    <a id="C9V7"><em>7</em> </a>Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C9V8"><em>8</em> </a>Also in Horeb ye provoked the Lord to wrath, so that the Lord was angry with you to have destroyed you.<br />
    <a id="C9V9"><em>9</em> </a>When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:<br />
    <a id="C9V10"><em>10</em> </a>And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the Lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.<br />
    <a id="C9V11"><em>11</em> </a>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.<br />
    <a id="C9V12"><em>12</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.<br />
    <a id="C9V13"><em>13</em> </a>Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:<br />
    <a id="C9V14"><em>14</em> </a>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.<br />
    <a id="C9V15"><em>15</em> </a>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.<br />
    <a id="C9V16"><em>16</em> </a>And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the Lord had commanded you.<br />
    <a id="C9V17"><em>17</em> </a>And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.<br />
    <a id="C9V18"><em>18</em> </a>And I fell down before the Lord , as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord , to provoke him to anger.<br />
    <a id="C9V19"><em>19</em> </a>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you. But the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also.<br />
    <a id="C9V20"><em>20</em> </a>And the Lord was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.<br />
    <a id="C9V21"><em>21</em> </a>And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.<br />
    <a id="C9V22"><em>22</em> </a>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the Lord to wrath.<br />
    <a id="C9V23"><em>23</em> </a>Likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.<br />
    <a id="C9V24"><em>24</em> </a>Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you.<br />
    <a id="C9V25"><em>25</em> </a>Thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights, as I fell down at the first; because the Lord had said he would destroy you.<br />
    <a id="C9V26"><em>26</em> </a>I prayed therefore unto the Lord , and said, O Lord God , destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.<br />
    <a id="C9V27"><em>27</em> </a>Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:<br />
    <a id="C9V28"><em>28</em> </a>Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.<br />

<p><a id="C10V1"><em>1</em> </a>At that time the Lord said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.<br />

    <a id="C10V3"><em>3</em> </a>And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.<br />

    <a id="C10V6"><em>6</em> </a>And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.<br />

    <a id="C10V8"><em>8</em> </a>At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord , to stand before the Lord to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.<br />

    <a id="C10V10"><em>10</em> </a>And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the Lord hearkened unto me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy thee.<br />
    <a id="C10V11"><em>11</em> </a>And the Lord said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.<br />

    <a id="C32V10"><em>10</em> </a>He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.<br />
    <a id="C32V11"><em>11</em> </a>As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:<br />
    <a id="C32V12"><em>12</em> </a>So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.<br />
    <a id="C32V13"><em>13</em> </a>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;<br />
    <a id="C32V14"><em>14</em> </a>Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.<br />
    <a id="C32V15"><em>15</em> </a>But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.<br />
    <a id="C32V16"><em>16</em> </a>They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.<br />
    <a id="C32V17"><em>17</em> </a>They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.<br />
    <a id="C32V18"><em>18</em> </a>Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.<br />
    <a id="C32V19"><em>19</em> </a>And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.<br />
    <a id="C32V20"><em>20</em> </a>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.<br />
    <a id="C32V21"><em>21</em> </a>They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.<br />
    <a id="C32V22"><em>22</em> </a>For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.<br />
    <a id="C32V23"><em>23</em> </a>I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.<br />
    <a id="C32V24"><em>24</em> </a>They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.<br />
    <a id="C32V25"><em>25</em> </a>The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.<br />
    <a id="C32V26"><em>26</em> </a>I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:<br />
    <a id="C32V27"><em>27</em> </a>Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.<br />
    <a id="C32V28"><em>28</em> </a>For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.<br />
    <a id="C32V29"><em>29</em> </a>O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!<br />
    <a id="C32V30"><em>30</em> </a>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?<br />
    <a id="C32V31"><em>31</em> </a>For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.<br />
    <a id="C32V32"><em>32</em> </a>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:<br />
    <a id="C32V33"><em>33</em> </a>Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.<br />
    <a id="C32V34"><em>34</em> </a>Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?<br />
    <a id="C32V35"><em>35</em> </a>To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.<br />
    <a id="C32V36"><em>36</em> </a>For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.<br />
    <a id="C32V37"><em>37</em> </a>And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,<br />
    <a id="C32V38"><em>38</em> </a>Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.<br />
    <a id="C32V39"><em>39</em> </a>See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.<br />
    <a id="C32V40"><em>40</em> </a>For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.<br />
    <a id="C32V41"><em>41</em> </a>If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.<br />
    <a id="C32V42"><em>42</em> </a>I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.<br />
    <a id="C32V43"><em>43</em> </a>Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.<br />
    <a id="C32V44"><em>44</em> </a>And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.<br />
    <a id="C32V45"><em>45</em> </a>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:<br />
    <a id="C32V46"><em>46</em> </a>And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.<br />
    <a id="C32V47"><em>47</em> </a>For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.<br />
    <a id="C32V48"><em>48</em> </a>And the Lord spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,<br />
    <a id="C32V49"><em>49</em> </a>Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:<br />
    <a id="C32V50"><em>50</em> </a>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:<br />
    <a id="C32V51"><em>51</em> </a>Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C32V52"><em>52</em> </a>Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-33"><a id="C33">Chapter 33</a></h2>
<p><a id="C33V1"><em>1</em> </a>And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.<br />
    <a id="C33V2"><em>2</em> </a>And he said, The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.<br />
    <a id="C33V3"><em>3</em> </a>Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy words.<br />
    <a id="C33V4"><em>4</em> </a>Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.<br />
    <a id="C33V5"><em>5</em> </a>And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.<br />
    <a id="C33V6"><em>6</em> </a>Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.<br />
    <a id="C33V7"><em>7</em> </a>And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, Lord , the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.<br />
    <a id="C33V8"><em>8</em> </a>And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;<br />
    <a id="C33V9"><em>9</em> </a>Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.<br />
    <a id="C33V10"><em>10</em> </a>They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.<br />
    <a id="C33V11"><em>11</em> </a>Bless, Lord , his substance, and accept the work of his hands; smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.<br />
    <a id="C33V12"><em>12</em> </a>And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.<br />
    <a id="C33V13"><em>13</em> </a>And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord be his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,<br />
    <a id="C33V14"><em>14</em> </a>And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon,<br />
    <a id="C33V15"><em>15</em> </a>And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,<br />
    <a id="C33V16"><em>16</em> </a>And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.<br />
    <a id="C33V17"><em>17</em> </a>His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.<br />
    <a id="C33V18"><em>18</em> </a>And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.<br />
    <a id="C33V19"><em>19</em> </a>They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.<br />
    <a id="C33V20"><em>20</em> </a>And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.<br />
    <a id="C33V21"><em>21</em> </a>And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the Lord , and his judgments with Israel.<br />
    <a id="C33V22"><em>22</em> </a>And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.<br />
    <a id="C33V23"><em>23</em> </a>And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the Lord : possess thou the west and the south.<br />
    <a id="C33V24"><em>24</em> </a>And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.<br />
    <a id="C33V25"><em>25</em> </a>Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.<br />
    <a id="C33V26"><em>26</em> </a>There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.<br />
    <a id="C33V27"><em>27</em> </a>The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.<br />
    <a id="C33V28"><em>28</em> </a>Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.<br />
    <a id="C33V29"><em>29</em> </a>Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord , the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-34"><a id="C34">Chapter 34</a></h2>
<p><a id="C34V1"><em>1</em> </a>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the Lord shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,<br />
    <a id="C34V2"><em>2</em> </a>And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,<br />
    <a id="C34V3"><em>3</em> </a>And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.<br />
    <a id="C34V4"><em>4</em> </a>And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.<br />
    <a id="C34V5"><em>5</em> </a>So Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C34V6"><em>6</em> </a>And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.<br />
    <a id="C34V7"><em>7</em> </a>And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.<br />
    <a id="C34V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.<br />
    <a id="C34V9"><em>9</em> </a>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.<br />
    <a id="C34V10"><em>10</em> </a>And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face,<br />
    <a id="C34V11"><em>11</em> </a>In all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,<br />
    <a id="C34V12"><em>12</em> </a>And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.  </p></div>
