<h1 id="isaiah">Isaiah</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1"><a id="C1">Chapter 1</a></h2>
<p><a id="C1V1"><em>1</em> </a>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.<br />
    <a id="C1V2"><em>2</em> </a>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.<br />
    <a id="C1V3"><em>3</em> </a>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.<br />
    <a id="C1V4"><em>4</em> </a>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.<br />
    <a id="C1V5"><em>5</em> </a>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.<br />
    <a id="C1V6"><em>6</em> </a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.<br />
    <a id="C1V7"><em>7</em> </a>Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.<br />
    <a id="C1V8"><em>8</em> </a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.<br />
    <a id="C1V9"><em>9</em> </a>Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.<br />
    <a id="C1V10"><em>10</em> </a>Hear the word of the Lord , ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.<br />
    <a id="C1V11"><em>11</em> </a>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord : I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.<br />
    <a id="C1V12"><em>12</em> </a>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?<br />
    <a id="C1V13"><em>13</em> </a>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.<br />
    <a id="C1V14"><em>14</em> </a>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.<br />
    <a id="C1V15"><em>15</em> </a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.<br />
    <a id="C1V16"><em>16</em> </a>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;<br />
    <a id="C1V17"><em>17</em> </a>Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.<br />
    <a id="C1V18"><em>18</em> </a>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.<br />
    <a id="C1V19"><em>19</em> </a>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:<br />
    <a id="C1V20"><em>20</em> </a>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<br />
    <a id="C1V21"><em>21</em> </a>How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.<br />
    <a id="C1V22"><em>22</em> </a>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:<br />
    <a id="C1V23"><em>23</em> </a>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.<br />
    <a id="C1V24"><em>24</em> </a>Therefore saith the Lord , the Lord of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:<br />
    <a id="C1V25"><em>25</em> </a>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy tin:<br />
    <a id="C1V26"><em>26</em> </a>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.<br />
    <a id="C1V27"><em>27</em> </a>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.<br />
    <a id="C1V28"><em>28</em> </a>And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.<br />
    <a id="C1V29"><em>29</em> </a>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.<br />
    <a id="C1V30"><em>30</em> </a>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.<br />
    <a id="C1V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-2"><a id="C2">Chapter 2</a></h2>
<p><a id="C2V1"><em>1</em> </a>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.<br />
    <a id="C2V2"><em>2</em> </a>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord 's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.<br />
    <a id="C2V3"><em>3</em> </a>And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord , to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.<br />
    <a id="C2V4"><em>4</em> </a>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.<br />

    <a id="C6V3"><em>3</em> </a>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.<br />
    <a id="C6V4"><em>4</em> </a>And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.<br />
    <a id="C6V5"><em>5</em> </a>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.<br />
    <a id="C6V6"><em>6</em> </a>Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:<br />
    <a id="C6V7"><em>7</em> </a>And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.<br />
    <a id="C6V8"><em>8</em> </a>Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.<br />

    <a id="C7V2"><em>2</em> </a>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.<br />

    <a id="C7V4"><em>4</em> </a>And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.<br />
    <a id="C7V5"><em>5</em> </a>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying,<br />
    <a id="C7V6"><em>6</em> </a>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:<br />
    <a id="C7V7"><em>7</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord God , It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.<br />

    <a id="C7V13"><em>13</em> </a>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?<br />

    <a id="C37V12"><em>12</em> </a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?<br />
    <a id="C37V13"><em>13</em> </a>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?<br />
    <a id="C37V14"><em>14</em> </a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord , and spread it before the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C37V15"><em>15</em> </a>And Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord , saying,<br />
    <a id="C37V16"><em>16</em> </a>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.<br />
    <a id="C37V17"><em>17</em> </a>Incline thine ear, O Lord , and hear; open thine eyes, O Lord , and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living God.<br />
    <a id="C37V18"><em>18</em> </a>Of a truth, Lord , the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations, and their countries,<br />
    <a id="C37V19"><em>19</em> </a>And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them.<br />
    <a id="C37V20"><em>20</em> </a>Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord , even thou only.<br />
    <a id="C37V21"><em>21</em> </a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria:<br />
    <a id="C37V22"><em>22</em> </a>This is the word which the Lord hath spoken concerning him; The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.<br />
    <a id="C37V23"><em>23</em> </a>Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.<br />
    <a id="C37V24"><em>24</em> </a>By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.<br />
    <a id="C37V25"><em>25</em> </a>I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.<br />
    <a id="C37V26"><em>26</em> </a>Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.<br />
    <a id="C37V27"><em>27</em> </a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it be grown up.<br />
    <a id="C37V28"><em>28</em> </a>But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.<br />
    <a id="C37V29"><em>29</em> </a>Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.<br />
    <a id="C37V30"><em>30</em> </a>And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.<br />
    <a id="C37V31"><em>31</em> </a>And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:<br />
    <a id="C37V32"><em>32</em> </a>For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.<br />
    <a id="C37V33"><em>33</em> </a>Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.<br />
    <a id="C37V34"><em>34</em> </a>By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C37V35"><em>35</em> </a>For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.<br />
    <a id="C37V36"><em>36</em> </a>Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.<br />
    <a id="C37V37"><em>37</em> </a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.<br />
    <a id="C37V38"><em>38</em> </a>And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-38"><a id="C38">Chapter 38</a></h2>
<p><a id="C38V1"><em>1</em> </a>In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord , Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.<br />
    <a id="C38V2"><em>2</em> </a>Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord ,<br />
    <a id="C38V3"><em>3</em> </a>And said, Remember now, O Lord , I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.<br />
    <a id="C38V4"><em>4</em> </a>Then came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying,<br />
    <a id="C38V5"><em>5</em> </a>Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord , the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.<br />
    <a id="C38V6"><em>6</em> </a>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.<br />
    <a id="C38V7"><em>7</em> </a>And this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord , that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken;<br />
    <a id="C38V8"><em>8</em> </a>Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.<br />
    <a id="C38V9"><em>9</em> </a>The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:<br />
    <a id="C38V10"><em>10</em> </a>I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.<br />
    <a id="C38V11"><em>11</em> </a>I said, I shall not see the Lord , even the Lord , in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.<br />
    <a id="C38V12"><em>12</em> </a>Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br />
    <a id="C38V13"><em>13</em> </a>I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.<br />
    <a id="C38V14"><em>14</em> </a>Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O Lord , I am oppressed; undertake for me.<br />
    <a id="C38V15"><em>15</em> </a>What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.<br />
    <a id="C38V16"><em>16</em> </a>O Lord , by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.<br />
    <a id="C38V17"><em>17</em> </a>Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.<br />
    <a id="C38V18"><em>18</em> </a>For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.<br />
    <a id="C38V19"><em>19</em> </a>The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.<br />
    <a id="C38V20"><em>20</em> </a>The Lord was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C38V21"><em>21</em> </a>For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.<br />
    <a id="C38V22"><em>22</em> </a>Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the Lord ?  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-39"><a id="C39">Chapter 39</a></h2>
<p><a id="C39V1"><em>1</em> </a>At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.<br />
    <a id="C39V2"><em>2</em> </a>And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.<br />
    <a id="C39V3"><em>3</em> </a>Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C39V4"><em>4</em> </a>Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.<br />
    <a id="C39V5"><em>5</em> </a>Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts:<br />
    <a id="C39V6"><em>6</em> </a>Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C39V7"><em>7</em> </a>And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.<br />
    <a id="C39V8"><em>8</em> </a>Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the Lord which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.  </p>

    <a id="C63V13"><em>13</em> </a>That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble?<br />
    <a id="C63V14"><em>14</em> </a>As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.<br />
    <a id="C63V15"><em>15</em> </a>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?<br />
    <a id="C63V16"><em>16</em> </a>Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O Lord , art our father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.<br />
    <a id="C63V17"><em>17</em> </a>O Lord , why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.<br />
    <a id="C63V18"><em>18</em> </a>The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.<br />
    <a id="C63V19"><em>19</em> </a>We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not called by thy name.  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-64"><a id="C64">Chapter 64</a></h2>
<p><a id="C64V1"><em>1</em> </a>Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,<br />
    <a id="C64V2"><em>2</em> </a>As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!<br />
    <a id="C64V3"><em>3</em> </a>When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.<br />
    <a id="C64V4"><em>4</em> </a>For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.<br />
    <a id="C64V5"><em>5</em> </a>Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.<br />
    <a id="C64V6"><em>6</em> </a>But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br />
    <a id="C64V7"><em>7</em> </a>And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.<br />
    <a id="C64V8"><em>8</em> </a>But now, O Lord , thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.<br />
    <a id="C64V9"><em>9</em> </a>Be not wroth very sore, O Lord , neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.<br />
    <a id="C64V10"><em>10</em> </a>Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.<br />
    <a id="C64V11"><em>11</em> </a>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.<br />
    <a id="C64V12"><em>12</em> </a>Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O Lord ? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-65"><a id="C65">Chapter 65</a></h2>
<p><a id="C65V1"><em>1</em> </a>I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.<br />
    <a id="C65V2"><em>2</em> </a>I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;<br />
    <a id="C65V3"><em>3</em> </a>A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;<br />
    <a id="C65V4"><em>4</em> </a>Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;<br />
    <a id="C65V5"><em>5</em> </a>Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.<br />
    <a id="C65V6"><em>6</em> </a>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,<br />
    <a id="C65V7"><em>7</em> </a>Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the Lord , which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.<br />
    <a id="C65V8"><em>8</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord , As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.<br />
    <a id="C65V9"><em>9</em> </a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.<br />
    <a id="C65V10"><em>10</em> </a>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.<br />
    <a id="C65V11"><em>11</em> </a>But ye are they that forsake the Lord , that forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink offering unto that number.<br />
    <a id="C65V12"><em>12</em> </a>Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.<br />
    <a id="C65V13"><em>13</em> </a>Therefore thus saith the Lord God , Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:<br />
    <a id="C65V14"><em>14</em> </a>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.<br />
    <a id="C65V15"><em>15</em> </a>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord God shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:<br />
    <a id="C65V16"><em>16</em> </a>That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.<br />
    <a id="C65V17"><em>17</em> </a>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.<br />
    <a id="C65V18"><em>18</em> </a>But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create: for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.<br />
    <a id="C65V19"><em>19</em> </a>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.<br />
    <a id="C65V20"><em>20</em> </a>There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.<br />
    <a id="C65V21"><em>21</em> </a>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.<br />
    <a id="C65V22"><em>22</em> </a>They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.<br />
    <a id="C65V23"><em>23</em> </a>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord , and their offspring with them.<br />
    <a id="C65V24"><em>24</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.<br />
    <a id="C65V25"><em>25</em> </a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the Lord .  </p>
<h2 id="chapter-66"><a id="C66">Chapter 66</a></h2>
<p><a id="C66V1"><em>1</em> </a>Thus saith the Lord , The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?<br />
    <a id="C66V2"><em>2</em> </a>For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the Lord : but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.<br />
    <a id="C66V3"><em>3</em> </a>He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.<br />
    <a id="C66V4"><em>4</em> </a>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.<br />
    <a id="C66V5"><em>5</em> </a>Hear the word of the Lord , ye that tremble at his word; Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.<br />
    <a id="C66V6"><em>6</em> </a>A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies.<br />
    <a id="C66V7"><em>7</em> </a>Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.<br />
    <a id="C66V8"><em>8</em> </a>Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.<br />
    <a id="C66V9"><em>9</em> </a>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the Lord : shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.<br />
    <a id="C66V10"><em>10</em> </a>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:<br />
    <a id="C66V11"><em>11</em> </a>That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.<br />
    <a id="C66V12"><em>12</em> </a>For thus saith the Lord , Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.<br />
    <a id="C66V13"><em>13</em> </a>As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.<br />
    <a id="C66V14"><em>14</em> </a>And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.<br />
    <a id="C66V15"><em>15</em> </a>For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.<br />
    <a id="C66V16"><em>16</em> </a>For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.<br />
    <a id="C66V17"><em>17</em> </a>They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C66V18"><em>18</em> </a>For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.<br />
    <a id="C66V19"><em>19</em> </a>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.<br />
    <a id="C66V20"><em>20</em> </a>And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the Lord out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord , as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C66V21"><em>21</em> </a>And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C66V22"><em>22</em> </a>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith the Lord , so shall your seed and your name remain.<br />
    <a id="C66V23"><em>23</em> </a>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the Lord .<br />
    <a id="C66V24"><em>24</em> </a>And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.  </p></div>
