    <a id="C7V3"><em>3</em> </a>Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.<br />
    <a id="C7V4"><em>4</em> </a>Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.<br />

    <a id="C8V5"><em>5</em> </a>Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.<br />
    <a id="C8V6"><em>6</em> </a>Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.<br />
    <a id="C8V7"><em>7</em> </a>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.<br />
    <a id="C8V8"><em>8</em> </a>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?<br />
    <a id="C8V9"><em>9</em> </a>If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.<br />
